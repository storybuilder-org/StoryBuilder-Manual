A concept is an idea that asks a question that implies conflict.  The answer to that question is your story.  

Concept is what begins to shape your idea into a story. Taking the time to create a compelling concept is key to a good story. 

Initially, phrase your concept as a "what if" question. Then use ‘What if? And ‘What happens is’ to flesh out your idea. 

A good concept sparks more “what if” questions.

Other Examples:

	•	What if Mary bore Christ’s child?

	•	What if a man justifies becoming a criminal out of family loyalty?
