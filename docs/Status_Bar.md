Story Explorer is the view in which you create and edit your outline. The order and arrangement of story elements in the Navigation Pane is entirely under your control.

Story Narrator is a separate display of your outline’s Scene Story Elements arranged into the order you wish to tell your story in.

Status Message

The Status Message displays feedback information from the program to you.

Filter Status

Indicates if a Search is active.

Changed Indicator

The Changed Indicator displays red if any editing has been done to the outline and green if not. It’s a reminder to save your work. It’s also a command button which will save your outline if you click it.
