C

catastrophe: A misfortune or disaster, usually sudden.   A plot in which events result in an outcome not in line with the protagonist's goals.

catharsis: The purging of emotions.  Aristotle wrote that the effect of tragedy upon the audience  is a purification of the spirit through the discharge of emotions, with the resulting relief from tension.

cause and effect: In stories, events must have a reason, rather than occur through coincidence.  Causes are usually the actions of characters, and are based on motives.

chapter: A main division of a book, usually numbered, but sometimes titled. Since you don't want the reader to quit reading, arrange your chapter breaks so that chapters end at places of high dramatic tension.

climax: The point of maximum dramatic intensity which occurs at a turning point or crisis.

coincidence: An event which occurs through random chance.  Readers don't often accept coincidence in fiction, but demand cause and effect.

conflict: The struggle between opposing forces.  Conflict is the force which drives the events which comprise the plot.

counterplot: A subplot  in a story which contrasts to the principal plot line.  For example, scenes which depict the antagonist's actions can be a counterplot.

slice of life: The term was coined  around the turn of the century  by the novelist Jean Jullien.   Jullien felt that plots reduced the realism of fiction.
