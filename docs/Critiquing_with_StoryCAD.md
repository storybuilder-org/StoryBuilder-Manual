Critiquing with StoryCAD

Although StoryCAD’s made to help you outline your own stories, it has another use: as an aid to understanding others’ stories. StoryCAD’s ancestor, the original StoryCAD, started as just such a tool.

Critiquing others’ stories is a great way to improve your art, because it’s often difficult to see your own stories with the distance needed to find their structural flaws and correct them.
