 <br/>
For most story element types, that Form contains multiple tabs. Clicking or touching a Tab name (the larger font) will switch to that tab’s content.  <br/>
 <br/>
In some cases (and particularly if you resize the StoryBuilder window down) not all tabs will show. In that case  the tabs will form a carousel you can scroll left or right by using the left or right arrows that appear at the edges of the tab area. <br/>
