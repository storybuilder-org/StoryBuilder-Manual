            <Title>Theme: Finding the Meaning</Title>
            <Synopsis>PRFIND

Premise is not 'meaning.'  More like 'finding the heart of the story.'

Theme is 'meaning.'  Need a topic for that.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Finding the Meaning

Readers expect the protagonist's problems to be resolved in some fashion, and not just left hanging.  But the solutions, especially to the inner problems which show character development, must have significance and meaning.  This meaning is the story's theme.  The Theme field on the Resolution tab of the Problem Definition form holds a synopsis of this meaning.

The theme or moral is derived from the premise.  To find the theme, consider the elements of the premise as symbols.  The above premise might have the theme  'Love overcomes depression.'  If you change the outcome and premise, the theme will also necessarily change.  If the protagonist gives up and is overcome by depression, the theme might be 'Grief overcomes even love' or 'Grief ends in tragedy.'

The failure to invest a story with this meaning can be as unsatisfactory as an unresolved story problem, because fiction, unlike real life, has to make sense.  While it's sometimes good to challenge reader's perceptions with thought-provoking ideas, the fit of the story to its intended market is largely determined by the theme.

Theme can sometimes be difficult to define.  The problem subject (contained in the Subject field on the Problem tab of the Problem Definition form) is a good starting place.  It's also useful to consider certain traits of your protagonist and antagonist as symbols which the premise describes.  Motivation, Values, Focus, and Virtues and Vices are the controls which are most useful in this regard.
</Text>
            <Notes>Theme should be the meaning; ‘meaning’, here, Premise, isn’t that. Rather, ‘Finding the Heart of the Story’ might be relevant.</Notes>

            <Title>Navigation and  Content Panes</Title>
            <Text>Navigation and Content Panes

The Navigation Pane allows you to view, organize, and manage the parts of your story outline in a hierarchical structure.  It’s similar to the Windows File Explorer, but instead of files and folders, each node in the tree is a Story Elements  Your outline is composed of five Story Element types:
Story Overview 
Problem
Character
Setting
Scene
There are also two  Story Element types to assist in organizing your outline:
Folder
Section
Two more assist in researching your story:
Web
Notes
There’s also a Trashcan node which is the parent for other nodes you wish to discard.

Clicking (or touching) a Story Element node on the Navigation Pane will display that Story Element’s  content in the Content Panel. Each Story Element type has its own form; the major ones are tabbed.
#



On some screen sizes and orientations the Navigation and Content panes may be stacked with the Navigation pane above the Content pane. In those cases the Show/Hide Navigation button (the hamburger menu button) acts differently; it toggles from the Navigation Pane to the Content Pane and back.

#


Your outline has only one Story Overview; it’s created automatically when you open or create a new outline. The Story Overview is the root of the Navigation Pane tree, and all other Story Elements are below it. 

Every major form also has a full-page tab (labeled Notes) which holds your general notes and thoughts regarding the story element. We won’t talk about these again; just be aware that they’re there.

            <Synopsis>TUTOR03</Synopsis>
            <Text>So far we’ve completed the first two steps in the story workflow, Story Idea and Concept, and added a few characters. We mentioned that Concept is an intermediate step between Story Idea and Premise, so it’s no surprise that we’ll talk about your story’s Premise next. Here’s our concept again:

What if a police detective uses a criminal's phone to gain time to effect a rescue, by calling the dealer at the critical moment?

Your Premise is the answer to the question your concept poses. It’s a summary of your story told in a sentence or two.  Although there are may ways to write it, here’s a useful template:

A character in a situation [genre, setting] wants something, which brings him into conflict with a second character [opposition]. After a series of conflicts, which are handicapped by a subplot, and after a plot twist, the final battle erupts, and character one finally resolves the conflict. 

In StoryCAD, one story element type, Problem,  contains most of the elements of the Premise, and, in fact, the Problem form’s Resolution tab contains a Premise sub-element. Your story can (and usually will) contain more than one Problem, and every Problem has its own Premise. StoryCAD is centered around Problems; they’re the heart of plotted fiction.

Our immediate focus is to identify a specific protagonist with a specific problem. We have a protagonist, Leonard, and we can take a stab at a Problem. Right click on the empty Problems folder and click the ‘Add Problem’ button (the question mark.) 

Since this is a 'cops and robbers' story, and these are often action-oriented.  Let's stick to that approach; Leonard's basic problem is to catch Charlie.  This defines the Problem Type as Conflict  and the Conflict Type as Person vs. Person, so we can select these values from their drop-down lists. We said that most drop-down lists allow  you to enter new values. That’s not true for Problem Type and Conflict Type: there are only so many of those.

The basic idea for this story was a situation or subject, so we know that, too (Crime), and we can enter it as Subject. If our original idea had been a character or setting, nailing down the problem subject would be a priority, and the list of Subject values might suggest something we don’t already know. Or we might have started with a Goal for the Protagonist and found a Subject which interfered with that Goal (more on that in a bit.)

Let’s take a look at Story Question. If you’re not sure what this is or why it’s on the problem tab, use the Help (‘?’) button on the menu bar and locate the property in the user manual. Here’s what it has to say about Story Question:
The primary reason your reader reads your story is to find out how it comes out, to find the answer to a question the story poses. It’s useful to clarify exactly what that question is. The story question can be framed as a yes or no question in terms of the protagonist’s goal: ‘Will Scarlett manage to save her plantation?’, or ‘How will Macbeth prove that his father was murdered?’
Consider whether the reader should know the story’s outcome prior to the climax scene. In many character-oriented stories the answer should be yes, and the story’s dramatic arc deals with how things happen rather than what will happen. If the answer should be no, the story question is the essential suspense of the story, and your plot must serve to keep the outcome in doubt.
Focusing on our original idea again, let's say that Charlie is highly mobile, conducting his deals all over town, and that he uses a combination of pagers (yes, I know, old tech) and cellular phones to arrange the deals. Our suspenseful question might be ‘Will Leonard and Tony overcome the cellular phone advantage’ and find out where Charlie Lacas’ next drug deal will be held, so that they can catch him?’:

#

As is often the case, one question leads to another. We’re also faced with the question of how the detectives overcome Charlie’s tech. 

We can treat this this issue of overcoming the advantage of the cellular phones as a  complication, by rewording the problem  not as a yes or no (suspense) question but as a ‘how do they overcome?’  Story Question. Your story can (and usually will) contain more than one Problem, and every Problem has its own Premise. Let’s add our ‘how to’ question as a second problem:

#

Neither of these problems are fleshed out, but we’ll work on that in a minute.

            <Text>StoryCAD for Pantsers

‘Not all who wander are lost.’ - J.R.R. Tolkien


The section Writing With StoryCAD begins by asking the question ‘How much should I outline’, and discusses the difference in ‘plotters’ and ‘pantsers.’ It ends as follows:

The gap between these two perspectives,  and the answer to the original questions, is to outline as little as possible to get to an effective first draft. The trick is to develop an effective workflow, one that gets you to the writing as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Before, during, and after 

If you find yourself solidly in the pantsers’ camp, here are some techniques and tricks  to ‘outline as little as possible’. 

You can use StoryCAD before, during, and after you’ve started writing.

If you’re ready to start writing, take a moment and brainstorm a list of scenes. You almost certainly have some in mind. At the start the list doesn’t  have to be exhaustive; it’s unlikely it will be. You can add a scene with	 nothing more a title and perhaps a line or two of Scene Sketch.  If you’ve jumped in and started writing, add the scenes you’ve written. You can always add detail on scenes, most of it on the Scene tab: the setting, who’s in the scene, and a  sketch of what happens. You can also use the Stock Scenes tool to find possible scenes to add to your collection.

But- and this is important- figure out which problem(s) the scenes belong to, and outline the problems. Do this as early as possible. Using any story structuring approach with these problems will suggest what scenes you’re missing and what you might want to write next. If a scene doesn’t fit into one of your story’s problems, it probably doesn’t belong in your story.

If you’re character oriented, outline the characters you’re visualizing. Details can help bring your characters into focus. Pay attention to their flaws, relationships, and traits- the attributes that lead to conflict. A story is a character with a problem; just as if you had started with scenes, you want to get to (and outline) that problem. 

Your character’s problem will often be a character arc- an  internal problem involving learning, growing or changing. Unfortunately, that’s usually not the story problem, except for Ascent/Descent plots such as Citizen Kane and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. The story problem’s goal should be tangible, easy to understand and grasp- usually an external problem. Think of the internal problem as an obstacle that needs to be overcome in order to solve the external problem, by seeing the flaw that’s at the heart of it and changing a behavior or problem-solving approach which affects the story problem. If you start with a character flaw, find a problem that correcting it can solve.

            <Title>Antagonist Tab</Title>
            <Text>Antagonist Tab

#

The problem's antagonist is the source of the opposition to the problem protagonist's goal.

Don't automatically assume that the antagonist is a villain.  Your antagonist should have perfectly valid reasons for opposing your protagonist— when seen from his point of view.  He may even think of himself as the hero.  

On the other hand, don't hesitate to use negative traits such as vices or prejudices, base motives, or aspects of the Shadow archetype in casting your antagonist if the story calls for it.

Antagonist

This control is a list of the characters who have been defined on the Characters form.  Select one of these characters from the list.

The antagonist may not be a person.  If the conflict type is 'Person against Nature', for instance, the antagonist might be a mountain or a fire.  In this case, you may want to consider defining a character for the non-human antagonist, and possibly personifying this force with human traits.
 
The antagonist may also be the same character as the protagonist, in the case of 'Man against Himself' conflicts.

            <Synopsis>TUTOR08</Synopsis>
            <Text>Having developed the characters better, we can return to the plot.  So far we have a skeleton plot, created with the Master Plots tool, and have added a couple of specific scenes, an opening scene and a climax. Our goal is to replace the rest of the skeleton plot points with specific scenes, not in count but in content and shape. Having a beginning and an ending is a good start. Every story is a journey. Of course, you're not bound to follow the skeleton, but our goal here is to illustrate StoryCAD's tools.  

Let’s return to our opening scene (‘He’s like a ghost’) for a moment. .  Both scenes and problems are miniature stories in their own right. The Scene form contains several tabs, Development and Conflict, that address what might be called ‘intra-scene plotting.’  Here’s the use of the Development tab:

#

 Every scene in the story should have conflict or suspense, and this one is no exception:

#

Our initial thought was that the conflict was between Tony (or Leonard) and Charlie Lacas, but since Lacas isn’t present in the scene (even though he’s the focus of it), the scene's conflict has to between Leonard and Tony, the ones who are there.  Conflict doesn’t have to be a fight, it’s any kind of opposition to your character’s goals or values. On the Problem form there’s a tool, Conflict Builder, which affords various types of conflict, but at the scene level, a property, Value Exchange, addresses this more subtly.  Our choice, Challenge - Acceptance, implies a choice to try to find a solution to their lack of information, and that in turn suggest a conflict: the alternative is Challenge - Refusal, giving up. The conflict in this scene, then, can be a difference in approach, mirrored in their feelings. 

The next point in the skeleton is 'Present Problem to be Solved'.   Since we've worked over the problems, we know what the problem is— the Story Question for our first, external problem: 'How can Leonard and Tony overcome the 'cellular phone advantage' and find out where Charlie Lacas' next drug deal will be held, so that they can catch him?' 

All we need to do is to change the skeleton plot point into one which presents this problem.  We can let Leonard present it to the reader, by discussing Lacas' use of technology. A single scene can, and should, server multiple purposes.

There are other tools to help you plot- for example, Stock Scenes:

#

Stock Scenes are exactly what their name implies: scenes that you’ve seen so often you recognize them instantly.   We used ‘The chase leads into an ambush’ as the setup to our ‘Leonard's impulsiveness lets Lacas capture him’ problem.
We didn’t call it that, of course, and in fact the capture idea we started with didn’t work: capture implies escape, and it just didn’t fit. Instead, our ‘The chase leads into an ambush became this:

#

Although the Scene Type we selected was ‘Action scene’, this is actually the Climax. If we go back to our Master Plots Three Act Play, we’ll find one more piece:

# 

We’ve added two scenes after Shootout, ‘Tony updates Leonard on the aftermath’ and ‘Tony confronts Jack Chun’, both of which constitute the denouement for our story. The  confrontation scene, we think, closes a plot hole, how the bad guys came to set up the ambush, namely, a double-cross by Chun. The Problem, ‘Leonard’s impulsiveness lets Lacas capture him’, turns out not to be the second problem all.  ‘Jack Chun double-crosses the detectives.’  Might be a better title, and one question to address is why the double-cross: the question of motive. 

These changes, in the climax scene, Shootout, and a better understanding of the second sub-problem, are typical of what occurs when you’re plotting in scenes. Your story, whether a novel or a short story or an episodic television script, is a series of events which are process the problems your protagonist is trying to solve, and which are linked by cause and effect. Understanding your problems, and using story structure, are the workflow that drives your plotting process.

Danger Calls is melodramatic and its characters aren’t as well drawn as they should be, but this exercise has been meant to show how an idea can evolve via a repeatable process into a workable story outline, and how StoryCAD can help you do that. The following section of the manual, Writing with StoryCAD, elaborates on this process, but the best way to learn is to do, making your own mistakes and solving your own problems. We hope StoryCAD helps you in your writing journey.

In the lifecycle of a story, StoryCAD is often used in the steps leading towards a first draft. These steps normally include research, particularly for world-building. 

To help you plan out your story better, StoryCAD contains two nodes dedicated to research. These are Website and Notes Forms and allow you store websites and your thoughts respectively.</Text>

Master Plots

#

Plots tend to include the same story elements.  Aristotle was the first to identify and expand upon some of these elements, which have been elaborated in the centuries since his time.  These elements have to do with the shape of the plot.

The same story forms also repeat themselves in fiction: stories of adventure, discovery, pursuit, etc.  Stories based upon one or more of these forms will tend to repeat certain story elements.

StoryCAD's Master Plots tool helps you shape your story's plot based on suggestions from these two sources.

The Master Plots tool is invoked from the Plotting Aids sub-menu of the Tools menu.  It provides a list of plot skeletons, or master plots.  Selecting one of the master plots from the list at the top of the form will display  notes relevant to that master plot. 

The first few master plots (Three Act Play, W-Diagram,  and Hero's Journey) are story outlines.  Selecting Copy when one of these master plots is selected will copy a skeleton plot into your plot outline, which can then be edited from the Plot form. The remaining master plots concern story forms or patterns.  Selecting Copy when one of these master plots is selected will add a plot point to your  plot outline.  This plot point contains notes and suggestions for stock scenes which are relevant to this story form.  You can copy more than one master plot into an outline.

Ronald Tobias' excellent book 20 Master Plots (And How to Build Them) is a detailed look at the fundamental plots which recur through all fiction.

            <Text>Inner Traits Tab

#

A trait is a distinguishing characteristic or quality.  As a fiction writer, you may find it useful to think of inner and outer (external) traits.  Inner traits are aspects of  character stemming from psychological and social causes.  External traits are habits and behaviors which reflect and illustrate the inner traits.  For instance, a girl may be submissive toward her mother (an inner trait) and may reflect it by bringing her small presents each day (an outer trait.)  You will want to find external traits to illuminate the inner traits of your characters, following the 'show, don't tell' maxim.

In the real world there are countless external traits, but fewer inner traits.  The Inner Traits tab can be used to select your character's inner characteristics.  Record external traits in the note areas for characteristics such as Likes and Dislikes,  Habits, and Skills and Abilities.

A menu item on the Characterization Aids sub-menu of the Tools menu,  Virtues and Vices, lists some external traits which can be positive and negative forces in the story, as well as sources of conflict.

Don't go overboard and provide every possible trait for a character.  Focus on the traits which serve your story's premise (see &quot;Plotting through character&quot;.)  Real people are often  complicated and confusing.  Characters should be multi-dimensional, but their motives, strengths, flaws, and growth should be clear and understandable to the reader.

Both the Inner Traits tab and the Virtues and Vices list in StoryCAD can be tailored to your needs and wishes.  See &quot;Customizing StoryCAD&quot; for details on how to add, delete, or modify the listed traits.

            <Title>Workflow</Title>
            <Text>Workflow


According to IBM, a workflow is ‘a system for managing repetitive processes and tasks which occur in a particular order.’ Each step in a workflow is a simple series of individual tasks, and focusing on just one step at a time divides the larger job (outlining your novel, for instance) into a series of smaller jobs.

StoryCAD divides your outline into 'story elements', such as characters, problems (the conflicts that drive the story), scenes (your plot structure), and settings.  

Story elements are the building blocks of fiction. They're taught in classes and writer's workshops, distilled in a story summary or synopsis, and they're what readers describe when discussing a story. In StoryCAD, you’ll mostly be working with the big four: Problem, Character, Setting, and Scene.  These story elements are created from templates- forms which organize and assist in thinking about that particular aspect of your story. 
Story Elements can be readily changed, moved around, or even thrown out and replaced with something better. 

Each story element is a tangible object;  its template describes it, breaks it down into smaller elements, and provides a you in its creation. A series of tabs organizes your work on that story element and focuses on one aspect of it. You can fill in as much or little of a story element as you like or need. A Scene might contain only a sketch of what happens to start with, but be fleshed out with a setting, cast, cause, consequence, meaning, conflict, and its effect on the plot, depending on your needs. If you can write the scene from just the sketch, do so; if it’s not working for you, try expanding on it. 

Many template elements are pull-down lists of choices. StoryCAD contains  thousands of suggestions for these parts, although you're generally not required to stick to them.  They (the suggestions) aren't there to limit your imagination, but to encourage it, to eliminate writer's block. Think of them as examples. The trick to using StoryCAD’s suggestions is specificity. This can’t be emphasized enough. Be specific. Instead of a Protagonist Goal of ‘Relief from danger’, try ‘Santiago must fight off the sharks to protect his catch’. 

Once you understand story elements this way, you can think of them as parts in your story factory, designing them and fitting them together, or modifying them to better fit your design. You can even copy characters and settings from one story to another or into shared story worlds. 

IBM’s  definition of workflow mentions ‘in a particular order’. With StoryCAD, this translates into creating certain story elements in a particular sequence. Your individual workflow may and probably will be different from other writers (or even different from one project to the next), but the general sequence is fairly constant and be thought of as Phases of Development, which are:

Story Idea, Concept, and Premise
Problem and Character Development  
Plotting
Ordering the Narrative

Each of these will be described in detail. These outlining or planning phases are followed by: 

Drafting
Revision

These workflow phases are outside of StoryCAD’s scope and depend on other tools. We recommend Scrivener, which StoryCAD has an interface to, but you can of course use the word processor of your choice. 

Saying that drafting and revising your story is outside of StoryCAD’s scope is not quite accurate; outlining can be useful during both phases, and we discuss that in Other Uses of StoryCAD.</Text>

            <Title>Problem and Character Development</Title>
            <Text>Problem and Character Development

A StoryCAD outline ‘begins’ on the Story Overview form, but as you’ve seen, it really starts with the selection of the Story Problem and its description in its Premise, whose definition could be condensed to ‘a character with a problem.’ 

How you approach these depends on the particular story, but also upon your own personality and style. You may be more character-driven, and need to understand your character’s journey to make sense of your story. Or perhaps you’re more driven by abstractions- ideas, concepts, situations and events.  Perhaps you’re comfortable with both. One isn’t better than the other, and you need both in order to complete your outline.

Always honor your muse by recording whatever it gifts you about your story: a bit of character description, a dialog or trait, a possible scene or subplot, a philosophical question a web link. This is a good time to brainstorm. But also, focus on the intersections of problem and character: your protagonist’s goal and motivation. After those are firmly in mind, concentrate on the nature of your conflict and its outcome. Once your protagonist’s inner traits and beliefs are molded, they cannot easily change, and he or she can only act in certain ways. Th other story elements must be consistent with your character's nature. Be prepared to amend your problem to fit that character.

 If you started with the problem (situation, idea, etc.), remember that there are infinitely many possible characters. Your job is to find the character who will face this particular problem. Ask why he wants to achieve that particular goal, and what sort of traits would lead to the story conclusion you want.  Then devise a back story which gives your character those traits. Until the moment your story concept is fully developed, your characters are as fluid and tractable to change as your plot or settings.

            <Text>Stock Scenes

#

This tool, invoked from the Plotting Aids sub-menu of the Tools menu, provides a list of several categories of stock scenes. These are scenic situations which recur frequently in fiction. 

While your plot and story should be as distinct and original as you can make it, stock scenes can be found throughout literature, and are a valuable part of any writer's tool kit.

Selecting one of the categories will result in the display of a form listing some stock scenes in that category.  Selecting one or more of these scenes, and clicking on the Copy control, will cause a scene to be added to the plot, immediately after the current scene, with the stock scene's title as the scene summary.

Stock Scenes can be tailored to display any sub-menus of stock scenes you wish.  You can modify the contents of the exiting sub-menus, or add or replace sub-menus.  See &quot;Customizing StoryCAD&quot; for more details.

            <Text>Ideation


A new story outline begins with the Story Overview form. It contains:

Story Idea
Concept
Premise 
Structure

The Story Overview form contains everything needed to get started, working through each of these tabs in order.
Story Idea

Every story starts with an idea. The idea might come from anywhere.  A conversation might lead to a bit of dialog; someone you see in a crowd could suggest an interesting character; a newspaper article or story you're read or movie you've seen might spark an idea for a conflict.  You’ll have more ideas than you can possibly write about, but regardless of where the idea comes from or how complete it is, at the moment of conception it's all you have, so a good place to start is to capture the idea. 

Launch StoryCAD and use Create New Story from the open menu. Change the story’s working title to something similar to its project name and simply jot down whatever notes or thoughts you have regarding the story.
Idea to Concept
A concept is an idea that asks a question that implies conflict. 
The answer to that question is what gives you your story, and it often works best if framed as a &quot;what if&quot; question. The Concept question should be the question the reader needs answered- it’s what propells him to read your story.
Concept formulation is all about questions, and isn’t necessarily limited to just one “what if” question. In fact, a good “what if” should spark more questions.  Consider Dan Brown’s The da Vinci Code for example:

What if Leonardo da Vinci implanted clues as to his views on Christianity and the veracity of scripture within his painting of “The Last Supper?”

What if Christ didn’t die on the cross after all?
What if the entire Christian religion is a contrivance and a deeply held secret resulting in a conspiracy?
What if there is a highly secret group of men whose life mission is to preserve that secret?
What if they are willing to kill to protect it?
… and so on.
Another good question is  “what happens?”,  particularly framed as a response to your “what if” question. It’s an account of your story’s resolution.
Your concept must imply conflict. To form a good concept, first ask: &quot;What happens if this crosses that?&quot; If you rub  things together, there is going to be a fire. What happens when you bring two people together who want different things? 
Concept to Premise

Your Premise is the answer to the question the Concept poses.  

Your story can have more than one Problem story element, and every Problem has its own Premise, contained on the Resolution tab. But only one of these problems is your Story Problem, and that Problem  (and its Premise) is the one you select on the Story Overview form, Premise tab:

#

The heart of plotted fiction is drama— a struggle in which the outcome is in doubt. Your Story Problem will lead you to understand whose problem it is (your major character), what her or she want (the goal), and what stands in their way (opposition.) The Story Problem is the wormhole you enter to understand your story.

The Story Problem has to be both difficult and urgent enough to occupy your reader from the story’s beginning to its end:  in Eric Bork’s words, “One big problem it takes the whole movie to solve.” Your story isn’t over until the Story Problem is resolved.

Before you can select your Story Problem, you have to define it. You may have created your new outline using a template that gives you blank Problem story elements (External and Internal Problems or Problems and Characters). Pick one (usually the External problem), or add a new Problem, and outline it in such a way as to satisfy your concept.

Once you have created a Story Problem that seems fit, write your Premise. The premise is a condensation or synopsis of the story problem; its purpose is to be absolutely clear as to that problem and how its resolution will resolve the story. One pattern for a premise is as follows:

A character in a situation [genre, setting] wants something, which brings him into conflict with a second character [opposition]. After a series of conflicts, which are handicapped by a subplot, and after a plot twist, the final battle erupts, and character one finally resolves the conflict.

Your premise doesn’t have to be worded in this format, but it should contain these elements. Here are a couple of examples:
Jaws
When a fish-out-of-water, big-city cop (protagonist) moves to a small, coastal town dependent on tourism (situation), he must team with an oceanographer and a crusty sailor to convince the doubting, money-grubbing townsfolk to close their beaches because a giant, man-eating shark (opponent) is lurking just offshore,  (objective) until the shark strikes (disaster), forcing the townsfolk to allow the cop and his buddies to take on the shark mano-a-mano (conflict).
Star Wars
A restless farm boy (situation) Luke Skywalker (the protagonist) wants nothing more than to leave home and become a Starfighter pilot so he can live up to his mysterious father (objective). But when his aunt and uncle are murdered (disaster) after purchasing renegade droids, Luke must free the droids’ beautiful owner and discover a way to stop (conflict) the evil Empire (opponent) and its apocalyptic Death Star.

            <Text>Social Tab

#

These elements are the major factors which affect this character's behavior and which come from the influence of others or the community.

The four socializing factors on this tab are important, but there is another, equally important source of social influence: specific relationships with other people.  Parents are notable examples.

Social factors may act as a source of story conflict, either externally with another character or characters, or internally within the character, war with each other in character, when contradicted by events or learning. , as a source of story conflict.  For example, a young white boy might have been raised to dislike or distrust blacks,  but the positive influence of a particular person of color  could conflict with that background.  This type of conflict is common in 'Man against Society' stories.

Fields:

Economic Status

Use this field to hold information about the economic/financial status of the character.

In considering this trait, consider wealth as a form of freedom; the poor are often shorn of choices which the wealthy enjoy.

However, wealth can also serve as an insulator, which isolates a character from real life. This is true more of inherited than earned money, so also consider how any wealth was acquired.

Changes in economic status can be powerful sources of conflict.

Education

Use this field to hold information about the character's education.

Education is a primary means of social mobility, or rising above poverty or humble beginnings.  But education is also sometimes associated with class separation, snobbish behavior, and lack of worldliness.

In either roll, positive or negative, education can place a character in conflict with his previous (before school) environment.

Ethnic and Cultural

Use this field to hold information  about the ethnic and cultural background of the character.  These factors can provide great color and variety to stories.

Be sure that you know the ethnic group or culture you're writing about, either from experience or from careful research— or both.  
 If you don’t know the group you’re writing about, get to know multiple members of that group. 

Be wary of stereotyping.  In fact, interesting characters often come from providing character traits which are at deliberate odds to stereotypes.

As with other social factors, changes in the ethnic and cultural environment can provide a source of story conflicts.  This happens in situations in which a person moves from one social group or strata to another,  such as from employment, travel, or marriage.

Religion

Use this field on the Social Background tab of the Character form to hold information about the religious background and status of the character.

Religion is not widely used in fictional character development except in religious market genres.  Characters frequently express religious beliefs, but don't show or act upon them except in unusual circumstances.

But religion can provide a foundation for characters in crisis, a source of comfort and strength when things are at their darkest. Consider It’s a Wonderful Life. A religious background can provide the basis for character choices at the turning point.  This is especially true for stories in which the protagonist is on the brink of a fall into immoral or unethical behavior.

Critiquing others’ stories is a great way to improve your art, because it’s often difficult to see your own stories with the distance needed to find their structural flaws and correct them.

            <Text>Story structure is the closest you have to a recipe for plotting your story. Your goal, in following a template story structure like the ones the Master Plots tool provides, is to create scenes for your story that fit into the structure you’ve chosen, and to position them accordingly. The scenes you’ll use are what develops from your characters trying to solve their problems.
 
We can replace the plot point for ‘Narrative Hook’ with  ‘He’s like a ghost’, the scene we added earlier. Let’s move our scene where it belongs, treating the MasterPlot scenes as they’re intended, temporary scaffolding. First, right-click on the scene, and then click on the ‘Move’ icon on the menu bar:
#

Click on the down arrow repeatedly until you’ve positioned it where you wish:

#


After we've moved our scene to where we want it, we can get rid of the placeholder by right-clicking on the 'Narrative hook' scene and clicking the Move to Trashcan icon. 

#

The scene will be moved under Deleted Story Elements. At the bottom of the Navigation Pane. If you think deleting a story element is a bad idea, you can move it back by right-clicking on it and clicking on the Restore Story Element from Trashcan button. 

The placeholder scenes added by Master Plots each describe one function, but it’s wrong to think that a real scene only does one thing. The ‘He’s like a ghost’ scene, our Narrative Hook, also Introduces Characters- not all of them, but our protagonists, Leonard Kraskin and Tony Irwin, and, from a remove, our antagonist, Charlie Lacas. It also Presents a Problem to be Solved- ‘How will Leonard and Tony get past Charlie's tech?’, which is in fact a sub-problem of the Story Problem, ‘Catching the drug dealer Lacas’.  To illustrate, here’s a reorder of the Problems.

#

The two sub-problems have been moved under the main problem, and our one scene so far (‘He’s like a ghost’) has been moved under the problem it’s a part of.  The MasterPlots tool was also used a second time, to copy a slightly different kind of story structure, a pattern of action- the Escape.  Back when we worked on our story idea we already had an idea of what our climax scene  would be; this placeholder represents that. Clicking on this scene, we can make it our own by renaming it to 'Tony diverts Lacas by paging him and allows Leonard to escape’ and using our story Premise description. We also added the scene cast members by selecting their names from New Cast Member drop-down and clicking the ‘+’ Add Cast Member button.

#

The Three Act Play structure we added under the Scenes folder contains a ‘Climax’ plot point, with Notes that read:

   This is the point in which the story problem is solved, one
way or another. Either the protagonist succeeds in obtaining her
goal, or she fails, or she decides that the goal isn't worth obtaining
any more, or she discovers something that changes the situation- usually
something about herself. It's important that your protagonist takes
her fate in her own hands and solve, or try to solve, her own problem.
Having the calvary ride up at the last minute is no longer acceptable.


Our ‘Escape’ scene under the ‘Leonard’s impulsiveness lets Lacas capture him’ problem is this part of the story’s structure as well. 

Plotting is usually the last thing in story design to worry about, for several reasons.  The characters should be well defined, so that their actions are consistent with their natures.  The story problems should also be clearly understood, especially the resolutions.  Every problem is a story in miniature; plotting a story is largely a matter of arranging events from one or more problems into a satisfactory sequence.  But writing is a process of accumulation, and the ideas which you collect to create your story concept can come to you at any time.  If you visualize a scene.

A drop-down list on the Status Bar allows you to switch between two views of your story:

#

Story Explorer View is the view you’ll use when you’re outlining your story and adding or removing story elements. Explorer displays every story element (of all types) in your outline and can be ordered any way you like. Scenes, in particular, may arrive in any order or time.

Story Narrator View is the view you’ll use when you’re ready to structure your scenes into narrative sequence,  the order you want to write your draft in. It may be chronological, or may involve flashbacks or flash-forwards, or may braid scenes by switching from one problem or sequence or viewpoint character to another. Narrative View displays only Scene and Section story elements, and the scenes it lists are references to scenes in the Story Explorer View. Sections are groupings: Acts in a play, or Chapters in a novel, for instance.

#

The  protagonist is the character who has the problem.  The protagonist of of the story problem is the main driver of the plot.  In the case of a subplot, that problem's protagonist may be a different character than the story's protagonist.

Protagonist	

This is a list of the characters who have been defined on the Characters form.  Select one of these characters from the list as your protagonist.

Goal

Motivation

In real life, things sometimes just happen.  In fiction, with few exceptions, they happen for a reason.  Motivation should be closely related to the story's Outcome and to the Theme.  The clash of motives is the abstract counterpart to the concrete conflict between protagonist and antagonist, and provides thematic significance to the story.

Motivation is closely tied to character— it could be thought of as the place where character and plot meet.  The psychological and social factors, traits, back story, and the motivation of your character must all be consistent.   Deep motives can only change as a result of character development or growth.

The list of provided motivations is not meant to be exhaustive, but covers many of those found in literature.

As with many other controls, you can modify the motivations listed to suit your own needs and interests.  See &quot;Customizing StoryCAD&quot; for details.

Goal

The Goal is the result or end toward which the character's efforts are directed.

As with all story elements, the more specific the goal, the better.  The Goal control lists a number of generic goals, which is certainly not a comprehensive list.  Even if one of these is selected, you should convert it into a specific desire: rather than 'To find a missing object', your goal should be 'To find the Maltese Falcon.'

            <Text>After the First Draft

Outlining after you already have a first draft sounds a bit crazy, but it’s not. A novel is a long journey, and long journeys to unknown destinations frequently lead to an occasional wrong turn. If you have a map to check, you can easily see where you went astray. An outline is that map. 

In StoryCAD, Problem, and particular the Story Problem, is key. Start by adding your scenes, and then, as described in ‘StoryCAD for Pantsers’, find your problems from them.  The outline doesn’t have to be detailed, except for the Problems. You want to thoroughly understand your Problem story elements.

Using your outline as your guide gives you a number of places to start editing- and every story needs editing. With StoryCAD you’re editing for story (structural edits) as opposed to line or copy editing.  Key Questions, for Problem and Character and Scene, will ask about specific issues. Does your protagonist have a clear story goal? Do the scenes show her actively trying to achieve it, despite opposition? Does the Story Problem have a clear resolution, and does your story end when it’s resolved? Do problems other than the main story problem connect to the story problem? (A clue to this, and a plotting plus, is a scene which contributes to both problems’ structure.) Does your protagonist grow or change (does she have an internal problem and thus a character arc?)

As is discussed in Story Explorer and Story Narrator Views, the sequence of scenes you choose to tell your story in (it’s narrative order) will frequently be different than the order you create the scenes as you develop your outline in Story Explorer.
You can move a scene from Story Explorer to Story Narrator at any time with the aid of the Navigation Pane Flyout Command Bar’s ‘Move to Narrative’ button, but another tool, Narrative Editor, can help you quickly develop your Narrator View by moving scenes en masse. This might be done late in the outline’s development, for instance.

Once you open the Narrative Editor, it will look similar to this. On one side you will the Story Explorer View (The view where you plan your story) and the Narrator View (This is the view that shows your story as it’s told.) 

#
The Narrative view is different from the Explorer view and contains only Scenes and Sections. Along the bottom there are several buttons:

Add Scene - Adds a node from the Story Explorer View (Only scenes and folders can be copied over, other types will not be copied over)
Add all unused scenes  - Copies all scenes in the explorer view that are not currently contained in the Narrative view.
^/v - Moves the selected node will be moved up / down 
Folder Icon - Creates a Section (Chapter, Act, etc.) in the narrator view
Trash Icon - Removes a Narrator View node
The Done button closes the Narrative Editor when you’re finished.

            <Title>Defining Characters</Title>
            <Text>Defining Characters

Character is the most important element of most great fiction.  A memorable character will live in the mind of the reader long after details of the story are forgotten.  Sequels are written about characters much more frequently than about the events in a story. 

A memorable character is a gestalt, the sum total of his or her physical, mental, emotional, and social characteristics.  A real person has all of these traits, and we expect a believable fiction character to be equally multifaceted. The Character form’s eleven tabs can provide you a rounded, three-dimensional character. Not all characters need that much detail: some are bit players or have lesser roles. But early in your story’s development, you need to meet and get to know your major characters:  how they look, act and talk.

As with all the elements of a story outline,  be specific and use details.  Giving the reader these details allows him to explore the character and learn his personality for himself, which is more effective than any explanation.

To go beyond the stereotypical, your characters should contain contradictions and flaws, just as real people do.  To build these paradoxical elements into a character, start with a fairly well-drawn character, and ask yourself what trait or characteristic would be at odds with that personality.  Then write the trait in. Often the contradiction can be built into the character's back story.

When you’re defining your characters, use conflict as a lens. Conflict is your story; always look for opportunities to increase it.
Agency

Your characters are your story’s actors, and so they must act. Thy must make decisions and carry them out, successfully or not; they  must drive the story more than be driven by events. Your story’s plot unfolds as a direct result of your protagonist’s and antagonist’s (and other major character’s) actions.

At the risk of being repetitive, the keys to this are your character’s goals and motivations, which brings you back to the Problem form. If  a character lacks agency, up his or her stakes.

Action, particularly action at crisis, reveals character.  Your characters must act in accordance with their nature.  Psychological factors such as Values and Focus and Inner Traits will show through. A character also needs (or must learn) the skills and abilities to act effectively. 

Action also molds character.  Normally, in fiction as in life, this occurs where the character's  innermost qualities are untested.  When a crisis calls upon your character to do new things, the inner traits will be revealed.  People can also sometimes change their inner values in fundamental ways.  This usually requires him or her  to 'go through the fire',  to undergo literally life-changing experiences. StoryCAD provides several ways to outline such changes. One is to describe an internal ‘Person vs. Himself’ problem and its outcome. The  other is to identify a character defect using the Flaw tab on the Character form, and resolve it. A tool, Flaw Builder, can help with this. These two approaches aren’t meant to be mutually exclusive. Finding a flaw exposes a character’s need, a goal hidden from the character herself. That goal is the basis of the Problem the character must solve through character growth. These are often problems of discovery or decision. 

Wants, Needs, and Flaws

You’ve defined what your protagonist wants, his external goal. But we humans have an extraordinary ability to deceive ourselves, and our goals are sometimes the very means of deception. 

The Defining Problems topic Outer and Inner Problems defined an inner  problem is some want or need within the character himself, a need to grow or change. 

Having both a want (the external goal) and the need (a flaw or wound that’s often buried and not allowed to surface) exposes a ‘wants versus needs’ conflict, and a potentially richer story. In these cases, what your character wants (the goal) and why he wants it (the motive) are at odds. Often what a character believes his motivation to be is a lie.


Socialization and Relationships

The Social Tab’s elements are the major factors which affect this character's behavior that come from the influence of others or the community.

The four socializing factors on this tab are important, but there is another, equally important source of social influence: specific relationships with other people.  Parents are notable examples.

Social factors may war with each other in an individual, as a source of story conflict.  For example, a young white boy might have been raised to dislike or distrust blacks,  but the positive influence of a particular person of color could contradict that background.  This type of conflict is common in 'Man against Society' stories.

Wealth is a form of freedom; the poor are often shorn of choices which the wealthy enjoy. However, wealth can also serve as an insulator, which isolates a character from real life. This is true more of inherited than earned money, so also consider how the wealth was acquired. Changes in economic status can be powerful sources of conflict; that works in both directions, towards richer but also towards poorer.

Education is a primary means of social mobility, or rising above poverty or humble beginnings.  But education is also sometimes associated with class separation, snobbish behavior, and lack of worldliness. 
In either roll, positive or negative, education can place a character in conflict with his earlier environment.

The Ethnic and Cultural background of the character provide great color and variety to stories.
Be sure that you know the ethnic group or culture you're writing about, either from experience or from careful research— or both.  Be wary of stereotyping.  In fact, interesting characters often come from providing character traits which are at deliberate odds to stereotypes.

As with other social factors, changes in the ethnic and cultural environment can provide a source of story conflicts.  This happens in situations in which a person moves from one social group or strata to another,  such as from employment, travel, or marriage.

Religion is not widely used in fictional character development, except in religious market genres.  Characters frequently express religious beliefs, but don't show or act upon them except in unusual circumstances. But religion can provide a foundation for characters in crisis, a source of comfort and strength when things are at their darkest.  A religious background can provide the basis for character choices at the turning point.  This is especially true for stories in which the protagonist is on the brink of a fall into immoral or unethical behavior.

Personality Type

There are a number of methods for classifying people according to type.   For example,  Aristotle classified personalities according to 'humor', or temperament, into four categories: melancholic, sanguine, emotional, and phlegmatic.  Carl Jung classified people as introverted or extroverted, and also used four categories: sensation, thinking, feeling, and intuitive. Today a system called Briggs-Myers Type Indicators, which classifies personality along four scales (such as extroversion / introversion), for a total of sixteen unique categories.  

StoryCAD uses  a different approach: the Enneagram.  This system is very old, and is believed to have  originated with the Sufis.  It groups people into nine types ('ennea' is Greek for the number nine.)  The system teaches that people in a given type often behave and react in similar ways.

You may wish to use personality types to better understand what motivates your characters, and how they may think and feel in certain situations.  But remember that a personality type is just a stereotype.  No two people are alike: one may be an only child; the other, the youngest in a  large family.  One could be born to poverty, another to luxury.  Each character is shaped by different experiences.

Intelligence

Intelligence is the capacity to grasp meaning.  Action-based stories generally  require less intelligence in the protagonist than do character-based stories.  A character who reacts, rather than acts, can be less intelligent. Your antagonist should be about  as intelligent as the protagonist, to insure a fair struggle. 

Values

People can have vastly different ideas of what is right or worthwhile in life. These 'governing values' are seldom articulated, but maintaining and defending them is a huge influence on an individual's behavior, because her self image is tied to the values she holds.

In real life, people have multiple values.  In fiction, it's more useful to think in terms of just one or two values.  Conflict can be created by threatening your character's important value,  by giving her two opposing or exclusive values, or by destroying or removing a value.

The choices for this trait represent common values people hold.  Be aware that different social backgrounds (especially different cultures and educational experiences)  may have profound effects on values.

Focus

The character's Focus is where he places his attention and activity.  His Focus (along with his Values) determine what's important to him.  From the perspective of plotting, these frequently determine what's at stake for the character, and therefore what should be put at risk— in other words, what the story problem should be about.


Misalignment of Values and Focus can create conflict.  For example, if a man values his family, but spends too much time earning money to support them,  this can cause problems. Your character may discover that what he thinks is important isn't, or that values he has neglected are truly important to him.  Stories of discovery and decision are often concerned with these situations.

Abnormality

This control describes the abnormal mental state of a character.

The line between normal and abnormal behavior is one of degrees.  Nor should you restrict unusual behavior to your villains.  A touch of abnormality adds color and unpredictability to a character.

Abnormal behaviors are complex and difficult to describe.  Be sure to research the specific illness you're using carefully. 




Manic
Manic behavior is characterized by mood swings, excessive activity and talkativeness, impaired judgment, and sometimes psychotic symptoms.



Paranoid
The paranoid has systematic delusions ascribing hostile intentions to other people or groups.  He often has a mission or goal associated with his perceived persecutors.



Depressive
A person suffering from mental depression exhibits  emotional dejection and withdrawal, and unreasonable sadness.

Depression is the most common form of mental illness.



Schizophrenic
Schizophrenics tend to  have disorganized speech and behavior, delusions, and hallucinations.  This severe mental illness is often associated with physical brain disorders.



Anxiety neurotic
Feelings of anxiety and helplessness tend to dominate personality and behavior.



Obsessive/
compulsive
neurotic
In this form of psychoneurosis, obsessive thoughts and/or compulsive and repetitive behavior patterns dominate the personality.



Phobia
Phobia is a persistent and irrational fear of a particular object, activity, or situation.



Psychopath
This character disorder is characterized by amoral or antisocial behavior without feelings of remorse or regret.



Sociopath
These individuals don't have normal feelings and reactions to social influences,  and can act in completely asocial or antisocial ways.



Inner Traits tab
Outer Traits ab

A trait is a distinguishing quality.  Unlike Psychological qualities which are hidden, these are a character’s attributes which can be seen and recognized through their behavior.  Inner traits are aspects of  character stemming from psychological and social causes.  External traits are habits, choices and behaviors which often reflect and illustrate the inner traits. For instance, a girl may be submissive toward her mother (an inner trait) and may reflect it by bringing her small presents each day (an outer trait.)  You will want to find external traits to illuminate the inner traits of your characters, following the 'show, don't tell' maxim.

Your outline is a tree of Story Elements which are displayed in the Navigation Pane. Clicking (or touching) a Story Element node on the Navigation Pane will display that Story Element’s  content in the Content Pane.

Here, clicking on the first or root node in the tree displays the Story  Overview  Form. 

On some screen sizes and orientations the Navigation and Content panes may be stacked with the Navigation pane above the Content pane. In those cases the Show/Hide Navigation button (the hamburger menu button) acts differently; it toggles from the Navigation Pane to the Content Pane and back.

Every Story Element type is a different form. These are the story elements:

Story Overview 
Problem
Character
Setting

Your outline has only one Story Overview; it’s created automatically when you open or create a new outline. The Story Overview is the root of the Navigation Pane tree, and all other Story Elements are below it. 

Every form also has a full-page tab (labeled Notes) which holds your general notes and thoughts regarding the story element. We won’t talk about these again; just be aware that they’re there.

The Conflict tab helps define the drama in a scene.

A scene is a 'small story', which has the same key elements of the overall story: a goal,  opposition to that goal, and an outcome.  The Conflict tab compresses the elements on the Problem form into a single tab.

Protagonist and Antagonist
These roles are selected from the list of characters defined on the Characters form.


Feelings
Motive is modified, at the scene level, into an emotional response which is specific to the character and the scenic action.  This control lists some common emotions.



Goal
The goal is the character's purpose or objective.



Opposition
The nature of the resistance to the Protagonist's goal.



Outcome
The result of the scene, from the Protagonist's point of view.  Most scenes should end in a disaster or failure to reach the scene's goal, lest the story end too easily.


The Dramatic Situations tool on the Plotting Aids sub‑  menu of the Tools  menu can help to define a scene's conflict, and works with the Conflict tab.

            <Text>Preface

Writing fiction is tough. Modern novels typically contain between 70,000 and 100,000 words and can take a year or longer to write and edit. Starting a project of such magnitude without a plan is an invitation to disaster, but how do you plan something as complex as a novel?

StoryCAD (distributed by storybuilder.org) is an outlining tool for fiction writers. It’s Computer Aided Design for fiction writers. The purpose of the outline is to manage complexity, a task made easier when you can visualize the structure of your story and individually address each of its many moving parts. The parts of good fiction are realistic, three dimensional characters who are engaged in meaningful and gripping problems, dramatic and suspenseful plots,  and settings that appeal to the senses. You fill in the blanks to create these story elements.

StoryCAD eliminates writer’s block by providing thousands of suggestions or examples for the details of story elements. A collection of tools assist you in creating conflicts, understanding your characters, and building your plot. StoryCAD is designed to simplify the outlining process, inspire, and keep ideas flowing. Each story element has a list of key questions: a checklist to help you refine your work.

StoryCAD’s layout provides a workflow to get you started, but you can work on any piece of your story at any time—add a scene, flesh out a character, or beef up a conflict. Whatever your story needs, for any form of fiction or any genre, StoryCAD can help.

StoryCAD frees your creativity and makes it fun. Mistakes in a StoryCAD outline aren't costly; you don't fill your trash can with them.  You're free to change and revise, to make mistakes, and to experiment.  

We hope you enjoy StoryCAD and find it useful to your craft. </Text>

The easiest and best backup is to save your work frequently at places where you're satisfied with your progress— milestones such as adding a plot point for an important scene, describing the physical appearance of a character, or figuring out how you plan to resolve a story problem. When you modify your outline, StoryCAD will display a red pencil on the status bar to indicate that  it’s in an ‘unsaved’ state. Use the File | Save option to cause the outline to be re-written to disk.

Backups are written to the folder specified in the ‘Backup directory’ selection in Preferences. Use  the browse button next to the specified folder to select (or create) the folder you wish to keep your story outline backups in. We recommend creating a folder just for this purpose.

Backups are suffixed with a date timestamp, for example:
	
	  My Story as of 11 01 2022 17 12 16.stbx

To revert to a backup, simply click on the .stbx file of your choice and use File | Save As to save it back where you want it. If you specify the same parent folder as your working outline, it’ll overlay it.

See Preferences in this manual for further information.

            <Text>The Importance of Setting

Setting often receives less attention than other story elements such as Problem and Character, and it does in this document as well.

But setting is more than just the backdrop of the story; plot and character are shaped and limited by the choice of setting.  Settings:

Provide much of the verisimilitude of the story, making it real and believable to the reader.

Provide excitement and color.  Much of the joy of fiction is to allow the reader to travel to other times, other places, and even other worlds.

Establish mood and tone.

Provide a source of symbolism and meaning for the story.

A Scene’s settings ties characters and their actions together.  Generally, unless you unite your protagonist and antagonist at one place and time, there is no conflict.  

Confined settings increase dramatic tension: for example, Murder on the Orient Express, or Titanic.  Setting also establishes the framework of beliefs and scope of action which some characters are more comfortable in.  A cowboy belongs in a western setting in ways that a ballet dancer or biochemist don't.  But placing characters in unusual settings can create or increase drama.

            <Text>Dramatic Situations

#

Georges Polti, in his 1895 book The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations, proposed that there are only a limited number of dramatic situations, based on fundamental human conflicts.   He defined each of his situations in terms of dramatic elements and examples.

In 2017 Mike Figgis, whose film credits include Internal Affairs and Leaving Los Vegas, revised and republished The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations, adapting the dated examples from long-forgotten writers Polti used to the more modern era, and borrowing examples from cinema. This is the source we use. 

The Dramatic Situations form is invoked from the Plotting Aids sub-menu of the Tools menu.  It contains the thirty-six dramatic situations and the dramatic elements of each.

The central story problem will frequently be based upon one of these situations, but the Dramatic Situations tool is intended more for use with the plot outline and with scenes.  Every scene can be thought of as a 'little story' with its own conflict; and each scene will therefore generally involve one or more of these dramatic situations.

This tool works with the Scene tab on the Plot form to help define the conflict for a scene.  If you select Copy from the Dramatic Situations form, the elements of the situation you have selected will be copied into the elements on the Scene tab of the Plot form for the currently selected plot point.

            <Title>Creating a Story pt 5</Title>
            <Text>The original external problem (‘Catching the drug dealer Lacas’) is solved through the resolution of the inner problem (‘Leonard's impulsiveness lets Lacas capture him’.) The story's turning point is the resolution of the inner problem, but an additional bit is needed, what we started with, getting the drop on Lacas. We should state the resolution of the external problem.  Clicking on the first problem from the list at the left of the screen, and then on the Resolution tab, allows us to key the Premise:

Lacas has avoided being caught before because of his cunning use of technology to communicate with his street dealers and customers. But Leonard and Tony have figured out how to trace the calls, and think they know where Lacas is. Using their new tech, and in two cars, Leonard and Tony zero in on Lacas when Bob Luhrs calls to place an order. They follow and find the house Lacas is using to dispense drugs.. Tony thinks it's too easy, but Leonard rushes in. It's a trap, however, and Lacas and Luhrs captures Leonard but hesitate, not knowing what to do with him.

The Premise is the same as the inner problem, with the extract bit (scene) added: ‘Tony's able to free his partner by communicating to Lacas with the Luhrs pager channel, distracting Lacas and Luhrs while he gets the drop on the dealers.’

Most stories have more than one problem, but an important thing to keep in mind is that only one of them is the story problem. The story problem’s easy to recognize: when it’s resolved: the story is over. Failure to understand that will lead to an unsatisfactory conclusion. The other Problem story elements must support that Problem, in various ways: inner vs. Outer problem, as a subplot, etc. If a Problem doesn’t relate to the story problem, it doesn’t belong to this story. The main problem is often implicit in the original story idea, but not always. You may find out which question your story is going to answer only after exploring the various problems.

StoryCAD acknowledges the need for a main story problem by having you pick the Problem that is your story problem, back on the Overview node. Overview’s Premise tab looks like this:

#

The Story Problem drop-down lists your outline’s Problem story elements. If you select the problem we’ve been developing you’ll see:

#

Note that the Premise here is just a read-only copy of the Premise on the Problem story node’s Resolution tab. Don’t forget to save your work- the red pencil on the Status bar is a reminder that you have unsaved work. You may want to take a look at the various backup and autosave options available in Preferences.

Your workflow may be different, but we recommend focusing on Problem and Character story elements to the degree that you know your major characters and their problems, know how your problems relate to each other, and know which problem is your story problem. When you know these things, you’re ready to start plotting.

Back when we started, we envisioned a scene in which Lacas walks out of the courtroom, a free man, talking on his cellular phone to someone, and laughing at Leonard, because of lack of evidence. That might be a good way to introduce the story, but our research suggests that with a lack of evidence, our guys wouldn’t have enough to charge Lacas; no prosecutor would charge. Maybe instead it opens with with our guys bemoaning the lack of something concrete to catch Lacas in the act with? Let’s try adding that scene.

Right-clicking the Scenes folder displays a fly-out command bar.

#

Clicking on the Add Scene icon on the fly-out bar will insert a new scene, which you can click on and rename by keying into the Name field. A sketch might also be added:

#


Of course, one scene isn't a plot. This scene might or might not fit. If it’s something you envision when you’re working through your story idea and concept and premise, trust your intuition and record it. Honor your muse by paying attention to those early thoughts. This goes for any story elements that suggest themselves. If they don’t fit, they can always be trashed.

Let's put a skeleton of a plot together, using the problems and story premise you’ve developed.

On the Tools menu there's a sub-menu with several tools to assist plotting.  One of them, Master Plots, could be useful in this situation.  The master plots available from this sub-menu suggest certain events which take place at different places in a story, and can quickly provide a skeleton plot outline which provides a shape for the plot. With the Scenes folder node selected, rather than go through the menus, let's use a shortcut and type in [Ctrl+M].  This will display the Master Plots menu:

#

Not all of the master plots are true plot outlines; other master plots suggest common story types which recur in fiction.  But we're looking for an outline, and the first few master plots do just that.

Let's use the first one on the list, the Three Act Play.  Click on the Copy button. 

#


The copy function populated the Scene folder with a series of plot points which suggest where in the dramatic progression of a story certain things should happen.  The Notes tabs on these plot points contain some suggestions.  For example, the Notes for 'Narrative hook' looks like this:

#

Although these are Scene story elements, they are not scenes, but placeholders: a reminder of things that your scenes need to do,   and roughly the order they need to do them in. In short, they are the structure of your story, its spine. Since your story is centered on one of your Problems, the main Story Problem, the story’s structure is the structure of that problem.  </Text>

            <Text>

#

A concept is an idea that asks a question that implies conflict.  The answer to that question is your story.  

Concept is what begins to shape your idea into a story. Taking the time to create a compelling concept is key to a good story. 

Initially, phrase your concept as a &quot;what if&quot; question. Then use ‘What if? And ‘What happens is’ to flesh out your idea. 

A good concept sparks more “what if” questions.

Other Examples:

The da Vinci Code
What if Leonardo da Vinci hid clues about Christianity’s origins in his painting of “The Last Supper?”
What if Christianity’s true beginnings are a secret protected by a secret organization?
What if Mary bore Christ’s child?

The Godfather
What if a man justifies becoming a criminal out of family loyalty?

When Harry Met Sally
Can men and women be friends? 
Can two friends sleep together and still love each other in the morning?

This tool is invoked from a button on the Character Form’s Flaw tab. It explores some common examples of character flaws to help you in developing a character.

Generally, a character flaw should become a problem of its own, a ‘person against himself’ or internal problem. The Problem Type is usually discovery; self-awareness is the start of the solution. The failure to overcome a flaw is tragic: Hamlet’s indecision is an example.

            <Text>Sensations Tab

Your reader can only experience your settings through the eyes and ears of your characters.  To make the setting as effective as possible, you must explore the impressions the setting makes on the five senses. This tab is a reminder to do so.

#


Fields:

Sights
This control deals with color, size and enclosure, lighting, texture, and contrasts.

Sounds
Sounds have attributes of loudness, tone, complexity, and direction.  The sounds of voices are of special importance: dialog is a character key. But these are setting sounds: bells, cars and trains, barnyard sounds, the rustle of trees in the woods.

Touch
This control deals with tactile sensations such as texture, temperature,  or pain.  Physical contact between characters, from the embrace of lovers to a father resting his hand on his son's shoulders, is especially important.

Smell/Taste
The other senses are often neglected but can be very important.  Smells in particular can be effective in pulling a reader into a story; the sense of smell is primitive and powerful and taps into deep emotions.

            <Synopsis>Needs added</Synopsis>
            <Text>Where to put this?

In 1996, Debra Dixon published a book, Goal, Motivation, &amp; Conflict: The Building Blocks of Good Fiction (Gryphon Books, 1996). A decade and half later, it’s rare to attend a writer’s conference which doesn’t have a presentation or workshop or at least some mention of GMC. When you consider that authorities on writing tend to date rather back further, such as Aristotle’s Poetics (335 BC),  or Gustav Freytag’s Die Technic des Dramas  (1863), that’s quite an accomplishment.
The reason for this is simple enough; Dixon has identified relationships between elements of a plotted story which were previously not given sufficient  attention. They are:
G = Goal. (What is it the character wants to achieve? Or what is the character wants to avoid?)
M = Motivation. (Why does the character want this goal?)
C = Conflict. (What stands in the character’s way? Why can’t the character have the goal?)
These are all parts of each problem in your story (see Plot Defined, The Problem Is…, and Turtles, All The Way Down.)
Each element can also be recognized by other names, in the literature of writing craft:
Goal – desire, want, need, ambition, purpose
Motivation- drive, backstory, impetus, incentive
Conflict – trouble, tension, friction, villain, roadblock
What makes GMC interesting to me is that it deals with the intersection of character and plot. The literature of the craft of writing often discusses the need for strong characters, and of the need for good plots. How they tie together is no longer a mystery, thanks to Ms. Dixon.
If a problem your protagonist faces don’t have a strong enough goal- if he doesn’t want it badly enough- your reader won’t care if he succeeds enough.
Dixon carefully separates external and internal goals. Each problem must have both. 
See Character Arc.
If the goal is ‘What”, motivation is the “Why”. Motivation is key to providing verisimilitude, the semblance of reality fiction must have in order to be believable. If your character doesn’t care enough to seek his goal, your reader won’t believe the travails you put him through as he tries to achieve it.
Conflict is what makes a problem a problem. If there is no obstacle that will keep your character from attaining her goal, there’s no tension, and your reader won’t wonder What Happens Next?-  the question that propels him to read on.
What makes GMC unique in its discussion of Conflict is that Dixon not only creates GMC charts for her protagonist, but for the antagonist as well. This is fearful symmetry.
I can’t say enough about this book. Buy it and read it. Then re-read it. Then use it.</Text>

#

A character flaw is a negative trait that affects your character or others in a bad way. Flaws vary in severity; some are just unpleasant quirks, but a major flaw will have story consequences. It’s almost always at the root of a character arc, and must be corrected (a redemption arc) or will lead to your character’s downfall  (a fatal flaw.)

The Flaw Builder tool can help you find a flaw suitable to your character.

            <Text> Relationships Tab

#


The Relationship tab on the Character form describes significant character-to-character relationships.

Relationships are made when two people with a different set of values and often varying personalities come together. Relationships in fiction (and in life)  can be a source of conflict.

Most stories involve interactions between characters: adversarial, social, familial, romantic. A character in a relationship is distinct from a character as an individual; the relationship is a dynamic. Characters in a relationship behave differently when they’re together- a sort of role.

This tab is only one half  of the relationship; go to the Relation character  to define  the other half. Be aware that the two sides of a relationship seldom have the same dynamic.

Create a new Relationship

Click on this button to add a new relationship:

#


Relation Type

Select the type of relationship from the ‘is a’ ComboBox. If you can’t find the one you want, add a new one.

Relation

Select the character the relationship is with from the ‘to’ list of characters.

Make a relationship on the other character

Check this box to define the inverse relationship. To complete that relationship, however, you must navigate to the other character.

Once you’ve added a relationship, you can update its defining details:
#
Trait

Select from list of traits, or add your own.

Contrasting qualities tend to pull or push characters apart.

Attitude

If the trait is the external behavior defining the relationship, attitude is the internal counterpart, often a feeling.
If a Character has a character arc of growth centered on a relationship, it’s often about an evolution of attitude.

Notes

Use this field to record your ideas and observations on the relationship.

Remove Relation button
 
If you click on the ‘X’ button on a relationship, you’ll be asked to verify that you wish to remove that relationship.

Show and Hide a relationship

If you feel that the relationship takes too much space up you can hide the extra info (Traits, Attitude and notes) by click the little arrow in top right of the relationship. You can click the arrow to show this info again.

Glossary

Glossary

A

ab ovo: Telling a story by starting at the earliest possible scene.  See 'in media res.'  From the Latin 'from the egg.'

act: A major division of a play or opera.  Subdivisions of acts are called scenes or episodes.

action: The events which unfold in a story and which answer the question  'What happens next?'  Action comes from characters who do things in order to achieve their goals or overcome obstacles.

ambiance: The mood or tone of a situation.

anima: The inner personality of a character.  See 'persona'.  A term from Jungian psychology.

antagonist: The adversary of the protagonist or central character in a story.

anticlimax: A descent from an important or dramatic situation to a  trivial or less dramatic one.

antihero: A protagonist who lacks heroic qualities, such as well-intended motives.

archetype: A model or pattern with  symbolic significance which recurs throughout literature.

atmosphere: The dominant impression a story creates through such elements as setting and dialog.

C

catastrophe: A misfortune or disaster, usually sudden.   A plot in which events result in an outcome not in line with the protagonist's goals.

catharsis: The purging of emotions.  Aristotle wrote that the effect of tragedy upon the audience  is a purification of the spirit through the discharge of emotions, with the resulting relief from tension.

cause and effect: In stories, events must have a reason, rather than occur through coincidence.  Causes are usually the actions of characters, and are based on motives.

chapter: A main division of a book, usually numbered, but sometimes titled. Since you don't want the reader to quit reading, arrange your chapter breaks so that chapters end at places of high dramatic tension.

character: A person represented in a story.  Character is the sum of the traits and features which distinguish one person from another; the storyteller creates character by selecting these qualities.

climax: The point of maximum dramatic intensity which occurs at a turning point or crisis.

coincidence: An event which occurs through random chance.  Readers don't often accept coincidence in fiction, but demand cause and effect.

comedy: A story of light and cheerful tone with a happy ending.

conflict: The struggle between opposing forces.  Conflict is the force which drives the events which comprise the plot.

counterplot: A subplot  in a story which contrasts to the principal plot line.  For example, scenes which depict the antagonist's actions can be a counterplot.

crisis: A turning point in a story, at which a choice or change or decision must occur.  Climax refers to the emotional intensity a crisis should generate.

D

denouement: The final outcome or unravelling of the complications in a story.  The falling action which follows the final climax.

details: Specific and particular items or features.  Effective stories rely on details rather than generalizations, particularly in characterization, settings, and props.

deus ex machina: Using an improbable or supernatural force  at the end of a story to resolve the complications of the plot.  Such devices are no longer accepted by most audiences.  The term is Latin for 'god from a machine.'

dilemma: A choice between undesirable alternatives.  Effective conflicts in a story should be dilemmas; if the choice is obvious, the character's path is clear, and suspense is weakened.

drama: (1) Events which have vivid, conflicting elements.  (2) A literary composition which tells a story about characters in conflict.

dramatis personae: A list of the characters in a story and their relationships or roles.  Printed in the program of a play or at the beginning of a literary work.

E

empathy: Identifying with or experiencing the sensations and emotions of another person.   A major goal of fiction is to invoke from the reader empathy for the characters  in the story.

F

fable: A short story designed to teach a moral lesson.  Fables are often written for children and sometimes contain animals as characters.

fairy tale: A story about magical creatures such as elves, dragons, dwarves, etc.  Fairy tales are often written for children.

falling action: The part of a story that follows the climax.  See 'resolution' and 'denouement.'

fantasy: A story based on extravagantly imaginative characters and premises.

fiction: A literary work created from imagination and designed to entertain the reader.  'Effective fiction makes readers think, but the primary purpose of all fiction is to make readers feel.' — H. Shaw.

flashback: A scene or episode which relates earlier events in the story.  Flashbacks are often written as remembrances by a character.

foreshadowing: Writing events into a story which foretell a later event, so that when the later event occurs, it will have more impact or seem more believable.

foreshortened prose: Contracted or abridged narration which summarizes  story events or scenes.  Foreshortened prose can compress large stretches of time into a few words,  but is less graphic and compelling than writing in scenes.

formula: A plot created according to stereotyped or set forms.  Most stories follow a formula at a base level.  Good stories transcend formula through attention to  detail and complexity of characterization, motive, situation, and setting..

frame: A border which encloses story elements.  Examples of frames are opening and closing a story with the same words or in the same setting,  and the prose which surrounds a story-within-a-story or tale.

G

genre: A categorization of fiction according to similar milieus, locales, and dramatic situations.

H

hero: A character who possesses physical or moral courage, bravery, and/or a noble nature.   The protagonist, or central character, may be but doesn't have to be a hero.  A heroine is a female hero.

historical novel: A novel which is a fictional representation of actual historical events or persons.

I

in media res: Starting a story in the middle of the events the story relates, rather than at their beginning.  This is often done to provide a narrative hook, by opening with an action scene.  Stories which employ this device often use flashbacks to provide information to the reader.  From the Latin 'in the middle of things.'

incident: A distinct piece of action in a story.  Incidents may be related in a scene or in foreshortened prose.

L

legend: A non-historical story handed down from earlier times, or a literary work which is supposed to be based on a legend.  See 'myth.'

locale: The setting for a novel, play, or motion picture.

M


McGuffin: An object which is searched for, fought over, or fled from, but which has no value other than to set the action in motion.  The term was devised by Alfred Hitchcock.

melodrama: Plays which exaggerate emotion and relate sensational and thrilling action, often at the expense of character development.

metamorphosis: A complete change of form or substance, often caused by some form of magic or witchcraft, found in fantasies.

mimesis: A principal of drama proposed by Aristotle, which states that dramatic works should mirror and mimic life.

mise-en-scene: The surroundings and environment of a scene.  Often used to refer to the stage setting of a play.

mood: The prevailing emotional tone or atmosphere of  a scene or episode.

morality play: An allegorical play from the 14th to 16th centuries which involved characters personifying virtues and vices.

morality: Conformity to rules of proper conduct; virtue.  All stories, except for decadent works, are concerned with morality, since conflict involves choices between 'right' and 'wrong' action.

motif: The recurring subject or theme of a literary work.

motivation: The reasons and explanation as to why a character acts in a certain way.  Motives are often goals, and are formed from the character's background and traits.  Well-motivated actions have a sense of inevitability.

movement: The pace and force of action in a story.   Action is 'fast', description is 'slow'.

mystery: (1) Something kept secret or that remains unexplained.  Elements of mystery in a story create suspense in the reader (see 'suspense'.)  (2) A detective story involving a criminal act whose perpetrator is not immediately divulged to the reader.

myth: A traditional or legendary story, usually involving gods and heros or supernatural occurrences.

N

narration: Relating or telling events.  Narration implies a narrator, always either the writer or someone involved in the action, and thus relates to point of view.

narrative hook: Events or scenes placed at the beginning of a story for the purpose of arousing the reader's interest so as to make him read further.

novel: A lengthy fictitious prose narrative.  Novels are  usually 70,000 words or more in length.  Short novels are called novelettes.   

novelette: A short novel, typically 30,000-40,000 words in length.

novella: A long short story.  Novellas span the range from short story to novelette.

O

obligatory scene: An episode which the reader expects in the story so strongly that the writer is obliged to put it there.  Confrontations between protagonist and antagonist are often obligatory.  Obligatory scenes are a subset of stock scenes.

one-act play: A play consisting of one act.  A one-act play, like a short story, demands concentration upon one theme as well as economy in style, setting, and plotting.'— H. Shaw

outline: The essential features or main aspects of a project, which reveal its order and organization.  'Every literary work of any distinction is so ordered and organized that an outline can be made of its contents and structure.' — H. Shaw

passion play: A play representing Christ's Passion, usually performed during Lent.

pathos: The ability of a story to evoke feelings of pity and sadness.  From the Greek for 'suffering.'

persona: (1) A character in a fiction.  (2) The public role a character assumes or is perceived to assume (contrasted with 'anima'.)  Character development in stories sometimes consists of stripping the persona of a character.

picaresque: A story in which the adventures of a roguish hero are described.  Usually a comedy or satire.

play: A dramatic work intended to be acted out on the stage (stage play) or in a television show or motion picture (screen play).  Because they are performed by actors, plays emphasize dialog and scenes.

play-within-a-play: A scene in a story in which a miniature drama is presented.  Act III, Scene IV from Hamlet is an example.  A form of 'frame.'

plot: The order or sequence of scenes and events in a story.  The plot points generally progress from goal to conflict to resolution.  Motive is what separates plot from a mere string of episodes.  'The king died and then the queen died' is a string of events; 'the king died, and then the queen died of grief' is a plot.— E.M. Forster.

point of view: The position of the narrator in relation to the story.  Point of view covers not only vocal, spacial, and temporal aspects, but also mental and attitudinal aspects.  Point of view is to prose what camera angle and lens choice are to the director.

premise: The basis or proposition  from which a story proceeds.  The premise may be a moral the story is intended to illustrate, or an idea or concept it intends to prove.  See 'theme.'

problem: A matter involving uncertainty or doubt.  A character with a problem is the basis of a plotted story.   The major story problem should directly relate to the story's premise.

props: Furniture,  ornaments, and objects handled by the characters in a scene.

protagonist: The leading character of a drama or literary work.

R

resolution: The final state of affairs in the plot; the story's ending situation.

roman a clef: A novel which depicts actual  historical events and persons under the guise of fiction.

S

scene: A plot point which takes place in one time and place, and which involves a particular set of cast members, one of whom (the scene protagonist) is usually  pursuing a goal.

script: The written form of a play.  Scripts have particular formatting requirements which relate to the director's and actors' needs.

sequel: (1) A story based on an earlier work.  (2) The reactions of a scene's viewpoint character to the events in the scene.  Usually this starts with an emotional response and leads to a plan for new action, which starts the next scene.  Thus, a type of transition.

short story: A work of fiction under 10,000 words.  Often refers to a story with a plot; the term 'slice of life' refers to unplotted stories.

situation: The state of affairs at the beginning of a story.

slice of life: The term was coined  around the turn of the century  by the novelist Jean Jullien.   Jullien felt that plots reduced the realism of fiction.  A slice of life story attempts to depict a scene or character without contrived drama so realistically  that it invokes an emotional response  in the reader.

stereotype: A simplified concept of a character or situation.

stock character: A familiar character expected by readers in certain types of fiction, such as the hard-boiled detective or the prostitute with a heart of gold.

stock situation: A situation or incident which is commonly found in fiction, such as 'boy meets girl' or revenge. 

story: A narration of incidents designed to amuse and inform an audience.

stream of consciousness: A style in which a character's random thoughts are presented without concern for sequence, syntax, or reality.

subplot: Scenes and events in a story which are secondary to the main plot.  Subplots may  contrasted with the main plot (counterplots), highlight it by coming together at some point (braids), or be unrelated.

suspense: Uncertainty as to the outcome of an event or situation.  Suspense is  caused by posing questions for the reader but not answering them right away.  A man hiding in an apartment  with a knife leaves the reader wondering 'what will happen  when the tenant arrives home.

suspension of disbelief: The willingness of readers or the audience to suspend doubt about the reality of characters or events in a story.  For example, a movie goer may  ignore that he is sitting in a darkened room looking at projected image, and treat the film as 'real.'  Bad storytelling can break this spell.


T

tale: A story which narrates (usually in the first person) the details of some incident in the story's 'past.'  The narration is a form of 'frame.'

theme: The story's unifying idea, or motif.  Theme can be  a category, such as idea-based or character-driven, but in  common usage theme often means the story's moral or premise.  The  story's outcome and cast should support the theme.  See 'premise.'

three-act play: A formula for fiction derived from the five acts Aristotle described in his Poetics.  The formula is structured around the modern three-act stage play and describes which story elements should occur in which act, and by inference, the logical order of material in any dramatic story.

tragedy: A serious story whose theme is illustrated by a disastrous or unhappy outcome.  Most tragedies can be traced to some character flaw or defect in the protagonist.

transition: A piece of narrative which links one scene with another by  telling the reader that time, setting, or viewpoint has changed since the last scene.

twist: A sudden and unexpected turn of events.  A twist ending, in which the twist occurs at the end of a story, has effects similar to the deus ex machina, if not properly foreshadowed.

V

verisimilitude: 'The appearance of truth.'  The aspects of a story which make it believable to the reader, so that he will 'suspend disbelief' while he's in the story.   Ways to achieve verisimilitude include showing rather than telling, use of specifics and details, and accuracy in factual (non-fictional) elements such as procedures, settings, or slang.

vignette: A term derived from the art work which decorated the front plates of novels, 'little vines.'   It refers to a brief literary sketch or episode such as a character study or a single scene.  The term usually refers to a short, unplotted work.

villain: A character who represents an evil or unwelcome force.  The villain is a stock character frequently cast as the antagonist in stories.

            <Text>Let’s return to our original problem’s Story Question again:

What if a police detective uses a criminal's phone to gain time to effect a rescue, by calling the dealer at the critical moment?

We’re still working on our premise, and this is the time when defining Problem 
story elements is  critical. What else is there? 

We did throw in the phrase ‘effect a rescue’.  The ‘effect a rescue’ phrase raises the question: rescue from what? We could also ask where this phrase came from and what that phrase is even doing in the Story Question,  but it clearly seems to involve drama and more drama is always good. Your subconscious will often give you what you need, if you let it. Perhaps Lacas ‘gets the drop’ on one or both of our detectives somehow. We can add that as an additional story problem:

#

Rather than ‘gets the drop on the detectives’, I used one detective, so that the other can affect the rescue. But how did Lacas gain the upper hand? 

If our story idea and concept centered around and started with a character or characters, we would be looking for a story problem that fits those characters, but we started with a situation, and our characters aren’t too well defined. The heart of a story is a character with a problem, however. Maybe it’s time to look at characterization better.

Let's shift gears for a moment and think about outer and inner problems.  The section Defining Problems discusses this topic in some detail.

The outer or external problem we've just added has a physical goal— to catch Charlie Lacas and send him to jail.  External problems focus attention on physical actions and away from your characters.  To balance the story with a measure of character orientation, we'll add an inner problem for our protagonist to overcome.  Let's give Leonard a character flaw to deal with. 

Click on the Lenard Kraskin node and then click on the Outer Traits tab. The Content Pane contains a button for a tool, Trait Builder, and an empty list of traits. If you click on the Trait Builder tool you’ll see this:

#

Clicking on Behaviors will give you a list of example behaviors: 

#

And right there is what we’re looking for. Remember, we have no preconceptions about Leonard's character; he's a blank sheet of paper.  He can therefore easily be molded to suit the story, and giving him a character flaw by making him impulsive is a step in that direction.

Click on Impulsive and Copy Trait to add the trait:

#


Note that this is an outer rather than an inner trait. Inner traits are aspects of character stemming from psychological and social causes. External traits are habits and behaviors which reflect and illustrate the inner traits. It turns out that Impulsiveness is also a value under the Adventurousness  quality on the Inner Traits tab, so we can select that value as well:

#

We should remember though, that  to affect the story’s outcome, traits need to be demonstrated as external actions, under the 'show, don't tell' maxim. We need Leonard to exhibit Impulsiveness in an action that puts him in a situation where he needs rescue.

With this change we can now rename our third problem (Lacas gets the drop on Kraskin) to something more precise:

#

Both the Conflict Type and the Story Question address the flawed character trait.

As a Person vs. Himself problem, the Protagonist and the Antagonist are both Leonard, but before fleshing these out, let’s look at the Resolution. Here’s what I started with:

Leonard Kraskin, trying to capture the drug dealer Charlie Lacas. Lacas has avoided being caught before because of his smart use of technology to communicate with his street dealers and customers. But Leonard and Tony have figured out how to trace the calls, and think they can know where Lacas is. Using their new tech, and in two cars, Leonard and Tony zero in on Lacas. Tony thinks it's too easy, but Leonard rushes to the location. It's a trap, however, and Lacas captures Leonard.

This isn’t too satisfactorily; it has quite a few flaws. We haven’t spelled out exactly how Lacas uses his communications to his advantage, so we don’t know how our detectives are countering it. The Premise has the detectives in separate cars- are  they trying to triangulate a location?  Do they expect to send a message that Lacas will respond to? Who does he normally communicate with? Besides, he knows what the two detectives look like. Whatever they intercept wasn’t obtained with a warrant, and thus would be inadmissible. 

Not knowing Lacas uses his communications suggests two weaknesses in our outlining: research and specificity. Here’s hoping it won’t result in an FBI van parked across the street, but some research in how drug deals operate and in the communications technology  they use led to a clearer understanding of the story.  StoryCAD doesn’t have much in the way of research tools (yet), but every story element node except folders has a ‘Notes’ tab. I’ve added my research notes on the Notes tab on the ‘How will Leonard and Tony get past Charlie's tech?’ Story Problem.

Let’s start with the ‘Who does he normally communicate with’ question. The tool to fix this is the same one that gave us our Concept: ‘What if?’.  Our Problem becomes:

Can the detectives thwart Charlie's secretive communications network and find out when and where he'll be dealing drugs?

What if Charlie Lacas normally only communicates with a handful of selected street dealers using a paging system (see Notes)?

What if Leonard and Tony acquire a system that can intercept the paging messages?  This needs someone who can set it up. And I doubt it's legal to intercept communications like this. Information Privacy Laws say something like 'Information collected by an individual can't be disclosed to other organizations or individuals unless specifically allowed by law or by consent of the individual.'


The story is beginning to take on substance; we can start to visualize some scenes.  In fact, if a plot point occurs to you,  there's no reason not to add it, now or at any time.  Stories are conceived through a process of accumulation, and one of StoryCAD's strong points is that you can collect whatever pieces fit as you find them.  But before we start plotting let's continue with the problems. 

Character traits are also a means of achieving conflict.  Many stories don't have enough built-in conflict, which leads to contrived plots.  But conflict isn't necessarily limited to the interplay of protagonist and antagonist.  We can create conflict by giving Tony a trait which clashes with Leonard's.  The opposite of impulsiveness isn't necessarily caution, though.  Going back to the Inner Traits tab on Tony's record, we select Thoughtful from the Shrewdness trait:

#



It's tempting to fill up the screen, by selecting other inner traits at this time, but it's better for the story to focus on just one or two traits in a character.  

We can clarify the problems further.  The Resolution tab on the Problem form identifies the outcome of a problem. The outcome of the story's major outer or external problem is the most important; the story's over when this problem is resolved.  In this case, though, we might solve both problems at once, in a confrontational scene. Let's assume that we want a happy ending, and think about the inner problem's outcome:

Lacas has avoided being caught before because of his cunning use of technology to communicate with his street dealers and customers. But Leonard and Tony have figured out how to trace the calls, and think they know where Lacas is. Using their new tech, and in two cars, Leonard and Tony zero in on Lacas when Bob Luhrs calls to place an order. They follow and find the house Lacas is using to dispense drugs.. Tony thinks it's too easy, but Leonard rushes in. It's a trap, however, and Lacas and Luhrs capture Leonard but hesitate, not knowing what to do with him.

Tony's able to free his partner by communicating to Lacas with the Luhrs pager channel, distracting Lacas and Luhrs while he gets the drop on the dealers.

Does this work?  The story's over when Lacas is captured, and Leonard's inner problem, his impulsiveness, which might have gotten him killed, ends in his rescue.  The question is whether he learns and grows from the experience. A common pattern for inner problems is the ‘came to realize’ story, in which learning a lesson contributes to the   In an action-oriented story, this is less important, so we'll leave it alone for now.  However our story's theme  probably has to do with this character flaw (for example, 'Imprudence leads to danger'.)

#

These character traits describe the external physical characteristics and appearance of the character.  They are generally self-explanatory.

Use the Appearance tab to round out the physical description of the character with looks, style of dress, etc.

Both the Story Explorer and Story Narrator views are trees of Story Elements. The root of the Story Explorer view is the Story Overview node, and the root of the Story Narrator view is a Folder node named Story Narrator. Below that, you have complete control of the arrangement and order of Story Elements in the trees.
To aid in this process, both views contain a special Story Element type (Folder with Story Explorer and Section with Story Narrator) which are, as the names suggest, designed to do nothing but hold other Story Elements. The sample outline “Hamlet” illustrates this use.
Using folders is not a requirement, though: any node can be a parent node with children, or not. The sample outline “The Old Man and The Sea” uses this approach.
You can use any structure you like. For example, if you’re writing a John Jakes-style Civil War novel, you could create folders for Union and Confederate characters.
To help you get started, the File menu’s Create New Story command contains a Template drop-down which will populate your new outline with a starter set of Story Elements:
#

For example, the ‘Overview and Story Problem’ template will add these nodes:

#

You may find one or more of these templates useful early in your outlining process. However, your needs may change over time, particularly if you’re writing long-form fiction such as a novel or screenplay. To address this need, StoryCAD allows you to rearrange the nodes in your views, using two tools.
Drag and Drop

You can move a node to a different parent folder by simply clicking on it and, while holding the mouse button or pen down, dragging it to the target node you want. When you release it drops at the top of the target node’s children. 
Move Story Elements

The Menu Bar’s Move Story Element button can be used for finer control, such as moving a node up or down in a list of child nodes.  It can also move nodes to other parent nodes, but because each click moves just one node, it’s not as convenient as Drag and Drop when moving nodes over longer distances.

            <Text>How to Think About Outlining


How much should I outline? How detailed should my outline be? 

Lisa Gardner, in Plotting the Novel: Otherwise Known as The Real Reason Writers are Neurotic, writes:

And finally, you may complete this process only to discover that now that you have outlined the story, you have no interest in writing it. That means outlining is not for you. You are probably an “out-of-the-mist” writer, meaning that the story must be unfolding fresh for you to be interested in telling it. That’s okay as well. Some of the best writers out there are out-of-the-mist writers. The trick is to discover which method of writing works best for you. 

This ‘two styles of writer’ distinction is known in writing circles as ‘Plotters vs. Pantsers’. Plotters plan and outline; Pantsers write ‘by the seat of their pants’, by sitting down and writing. 

What’s different between these two positions? Several things: 
The Plotter must still write her draft. In fact, that’s one downside to being a plotter: you can confuse writing the outline with writing the story, even tell yourself that the story’s done.
The Pantser is more likely to write herself into a corner, to not know what comes next.
The Pantser finishes her first draft. It contains all that knowledge needed to rewrite a second draft, but it’s diffused, spread throughout the prose. She has to edit much more extensively than if she worked from a good outline.
Here’s the killer: the Pantser had to face a blank page every day in order to get through that draft.  She often worked without a net, not knowing where her story was going. The plotter did too- while she was writing her outline. But there is a big difference in writing a few pages of outline and in writing a 200-page draft. The outline is more tractable. That’s what makes Pantsing a plotting issue.
The gap between these two perspectives,  and the answer to the original questions, is to outline as little as possible to get to an effective first draft. The trick is to develop an effective workflow, one that gets you to the writing as quickly and efficiently as possible.

            <Title>Problem Form</Title>
            <Text>Problem Form

The short definition for a story is trouble.  Like people, stories are at their best when things are at their worst. 

You create a problem by devising a goal for  one of your story's characters, the Protagonist, and a motive which propels him or her to strive for the goal. You next define conflict: an opponent , the Antagonist,  who tries to  prevent the protagonist from reaching his or her goal.  The conflict leaves the outcome uncertain, which keeps the reader turning pages to find out what happens.

A problem resolves in one of two ways: successfully or not. Both have their place in fiction. If the main story problem has a good outcome,  the story has a happy ending; if it’s a bad outcome, the story’s a tragedy. Other problems’ bad outcomes represent setbacks for the protagonist, whereas good outcomes  

The protagonist may not initially be aware of his need (this is common in stories of discovery).  The antagonist may not even be human, but a force or process or situation.  But all problems have the elements of goal, motivation, and conflict.

A story can  and usually will have multiple problems, but only one of them is the main story problem. When that problem is resolved, the story is over.

            <Title>Role Tab</Title>
            <Text>Role Tab

#

The role tab contains the information which defines the relationship between this character and the story.

Unless your story's conception started with a particular character in mind, you should define the role before any other aspects of the character.

Role

The Role is the part played by this character in your story.  It's often the character's occupation, since many characters' story context hinges on their job or work.  The role may be stereotypical— 'private eye' brings to mind a composite image of thousands of fictional characters.  The character himself, though, should be as unique as you can make him.

The roles of major characters are often dictated by the genre.  For example, a western suggests a cowboy.  But placing a character in an unusual milieu can be very effective, as in the TV series McCloud, in which cowboy deputy McCloud is loaned to the NYPD and relocated from Taos, New Mexico to urban New York.

Another useful trick to liven up a role is to cross gender norms in casting the part, such as with a lady alligator wrestler, or a man who runs a wedding dress shop.

Story Role

The story role is the relative importance of the character's part  to the story's development.

The more significant a character is to the story, the more fully developed he or she should be.  The characters in major roles should ideally be so rounded out that they 'come alive'.  Writing scenes for such a well-developed character often becomes a matter of putting him in a situation and watching how he reacts.

StoryCAD assigns four levels to characters:


Major Role
The protagonist and antagonist are major characters.  If the story's dramatic arc hinges on other parts, they may also be major characters.  A love triangle involves three major roles: protagonist, love interest, and rival.



Supporting
Role
Supporting roles are defined by the plot.  Characters who appear in many scenes, but don't directly carry the plot, are supporting characters.  Supporting roles should be well rounded.  These roles can often be made very colorful.



Minor Role
The character in a minor role appears briefly in the story, but has a story purpose and dialog.  Minor Roles are often used to convey information.



Service Role
A service role is a walk on part.  Service role characters are created to fill a specific plot requirement but are otherwise not a part of the story.  A taxicab driver, needed to get the hero to the airport, is a service role.



Archetype

An archetype is a prototype or model from which something is based.  The character archetypes listed here derive from Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces, and  are deeply rooted in the myths and legends of many cultures.  A significant character's role can often be associated with one of these archetypes.


Hero
The essence of the  hero is not bravery or nobility, but self-sacrifice.  The mythic hero is one who will endure separation and hardship for the sake of his clan.  The hero must pay a price to obtain his goal.

The hero's journey during a story is a path from the ego, the self, to a new identity which has grown to include the experiences of the story.  This path often consists of a separation from family or group to a new, unfamiliar and challenging world (even if it's his own back yard), and finally a return to the ordinary, but now expanded, world.

The hero must learn in order to grow.  Often the heart of a story is not the obstacles he faces, but the new wisdom he acquires, from a mentor, a lover, or even from the villain.

Other characters besides the protagonist can have heroic qualities.  This can be especially true of the antagonist.

Heroes can be willing and adventurous, or reluctant.   They may be group and family oriented, or loners.  They may change and grow themselves, or act as catalysts for others to grow and act heroic.  The hero can be an innocent, a wanderer, a martyr, a warrior, a vengeful destroyer, a ruler, or a fool.  But the essence of the hero is the sacrifice he makes to achieve his goal.



Mentor
The mentor is a character who aids or trains the hero.  The essence of the mentor is the wise old man or woman.  The mentor represents the wiser and more godlike qualities within us.

The mentor's role may be to teach the hero.  These characters are often found in the roles of drill instructor, squad leader or sergeant, the older officer policeman, the aged warrior training the squire, trail boss, parent or grandparent, etc.  An effective teacher may be an otherwise inept or foolish character who possesses just the skill or wisdom the hero needs for his challenge.

The other major role of the mentor is to equip the hero by giving him a gift or gifts which are important in his quest.  These gifts may be weapons, medicine or food, magic, or some important clue or piece of information.  Frequently, the mentor requires the hero to have passed some sort of test before receiving the gift. The gift may be a seemingly insignificant object,  the importance of which doesn't emerge until later. 

The mentor may occasionally be the hero's conscience, returning him to the right path after he strays or strengthening him when he weakens.  The hero doesn't always appreciate this assistance, of course.



Threshold
Guardian
The threshold guardian is the first obstacle to the hero in his journey.  The threshold is the gateway to the new world the hero must enter to change and grow. 

The threshold guardian is usually not the story's antagonist.  Only after this initial test has been surpassed will the hero face the true contest and the arch-villain.   Frequently the threshold guardian is a henchman or employee of the antagonist.

But the threshold guardian can also be an otherwise neutral character, or even a potential ally— such as the police lieutenant who warns the hero private detective off the case, or the Cowardly Lion who first frightens and then joins Dorothy on her journey to Oz.

The role of the threshold guardian is to test the hero's mettle and worthiness to begin the story's journey, and to show that the journey will not be easy.  The hero will encounter the guardian early in the story, usually right after he starts his quest.



Herald
The role of the herald is to announce the challenge which begins the hero on his story journey.  The herald is the person or piece of information which upsets the sleepy equilibrium in which the hero has lived and starts the adventure.

The herald need not be a person.  It can be an event or force— the start of a war, a drought or famine, or even an ad in a newspaper.



Shapeshifter
The shapeshifter changes role or personality, often in significant ways, and is hard to understand.  That very changeability is the essence of this archetype.  The shapeshifter's alliances and loyalty are uncertain, and the sincerity of his claims is often questionable.  This keeps the hero off guard.

The shapeshifter is often a person of the opposite sex, often the hero's romantic interest.  In other stories the shapeshifter may be a friend or ally of the same sex, often a buddy figure, or in fantasies, a magical figure such as a shaman or wizard.

The shapeshifter is sometimes a catalyst whose changing nature forces changes in the hero, but the normal role is to bring suspense into a story by forcing the reader, along with the hero, to question beliefs and assumptions.

As with the other archetypes, any character, including the protagonist and antagonist, can take on attributes of the shapeshifter at different times in the story. The hero often assumes the role of shapeshifter to get past an obstacle.  Mentors often appear as shapeshifters.



Shadow
The Shadow archetype is a negative figure, representing things we don't like and would like to eliminate.

The shadow often takes the form of the antagonist in a story.  But not all antagonists are villains; sometimes the antagonist is a good guy whose goals disagree with the protagonist's.  If the antagonist is a villain, though, he's a shadow.

The shadow is the worthy opponent with whom the hero must struggle. In a conflict between hero and villain, the fight is to the end; one or the other must be destroyed or rendered impotent.

While the shadow is a negative force in the story, it's important to remember that no man is a villain in his own eyes.  In fact, the shadow frequently sees himself as a hero, and the story's hero as his villain.



Trickster
The Trickster is a clown, a mischief maker.  He provides the comedy relief that a story often needs to offset heavy dramatic tension.  The trickster keeps things in proportion.

The trickster can be an ally or companion of the hero, or may work for the villain.  In some instances the trickster may even be the hero or villain.  In any role, the trickster usually represents the force of cunning, and is pitted against opponents who are stronger or more powerful.

            <Title>Resolution Tab</Title>
            <Text>Resolution Tab

#

The Resolution tab describes the Problem’s outcome. 

It’s useful to think about where this Problem fits in the overall story. The final conflict and its climax should not only be the highest tension (greatest conflict), but is (usually) where the protagonist solves his story problem, and is often a successful outcome. Problems which occur during the rising action (the story’s middle) will often have bad outcomes, but even if they appear to be successful, will lead to further complications. 

Outcome

This is what happens (how the problem is concluded.)

Method

How the problem’s protagonist arrives at the outcome.

Theme

Theme answers the questions “What’s it about?” or “What’s the point?”. It’s the idea behind the action, what you as author are trying to convey. Every story, and every problem, has, by its nature, one or more themes. 

There is, however, a risk with themes, best illustrated by the anecdote about a screenwriter working for Samuel Goldwyn who inserted a socially significant message in his screenplay. When he pitched his idea to the producer and studio head, Goldwyn’s supposed to have replied, “From Western Union you get messages. From me you get pictures.”  The theme of this anecdote is ‘don’t let the theme get in the way of the story.’
 
Premise

A Problem’s premise is a a synopsis of the problem: of what happens to the characters as a result of the actions it entails.  

If the problem is fully understood, the the premise can be constructed from its elements in the form of a template sentence or paragraph. There are many potential templates. Here’s an example:

When a fish-out-of-water, big-city cop (protagonist) moves to a small, coastal town dependent on tourism (situation), he must team with an oceanographer and a crusty sailor to convince the doubting, money-grubbing townsfolk to close their beaches because a giant, man-eating shark (opponent) is lurking just offshore,  (objective) until the shark strikes (disaster), forcing the townsfolk to allow the cop and his buddies to take on the shark mano-a-mano (conflict).

A Problem’s Premise works best if it contains the elements of just that Problem form. The one exception is the main Problem Story Element (see Story Overview Premise Tab). That Problem’s Premise is also the story’s Premise, which summarizes the entire story and might (as in the above example) contain details of other subplots.

The Conflict Builder tool, invoked by buttons on the Protagonist and Antagonist tabs of the Problem Form.

Conflict Categories
Conflict Builder classifies conflicts according to a series of categories and subcategories and provides examples of each. The categories are as follows:

Criminal activities
The subcategories of criminal activity makes it easier to understand the motives and patterns of each.
Criminal psychology

This alternative way to approach crime focuses on the character of the criminal.
Identify conflicts
Identity conflict is a psychological phenomenon in which an individual experiences a discrepancy between their self-perception and their perceived social identity. This can occur when an individual feels that their personal values or beliefs are not aligned with the expectations or norms of the group or society to which they belong. Identity conflicts can lead to feelings of confusion, anxiety, and distress. They can also result in behaviors such as resistance, rebellion, or withdrawal from the group or society.
Relationship Conflicts
Relationship conflicts occur because of negative behavior patterns by or both parties,  strong negative emotions, misconceptions and stereotypes, and poor (or no) communication. They frequently involve pressure from other non-relationship issues (such as money) or third-parties. Relationship problems often follow a downward spiral of destructive actions. 
Information Conflicts
Information conflicts occur when people lack the information necessary to make good choices, are accidentally or intentionally misinformed, disagree on what data is important or how the data  should be interpreted. They frequently involve poor communication between the adversaries.
Interest Conflicts
Interest conflicts are caused by competition over perceived incompatible needs. Conflicts of interest result when one or more of the parties believe that in order to satisfy his or her needs, the needs and interests of an opponent must be sacrificed- that a zero-sum game is being played. Interest-based conflict will commonly be expressed as power struggles and rank pulling. Interest conflicts may occur over substantive issues (such as money, physical resources, time, property crimes, etc.); procedural issues (the way the dispute is to be resolved); and psychological issues (assault and crimes of person, dominance, perceptions of trust, fairness, desire for participation, respect, etc.)
Structural Conflicts
Structural conflicts are caused by forces external to the people in dispute. Limited physical resources or authority, geographic constraints (distance or proximity), time (too little or too much), organizational changes, and so forth can make structural conflict seem like a crisis. One possible outcome of a structural conflict- rare in fiction- is cooperation or a structural change. 
Value Conflicts
Value conflicts are caused by perceived or actual incompatible belief systems. Values are beliefs that people use to give meaning to their lives. People frequently coach values in terms of right and wrong. Value disputes arise when people attempt to force one set of values on others or lay claim to exclusive value systems that do not allow for divergent beliefs. Value conflicts are generally intractable.

Tabs allow you to easily switch between different sections of a form, rather than having to navigate through multiple separate pages or windows. A tab organizes and groups related information.

In some cases (and particularly if you resize the StoryCAD window smaller) not all tabs will show. In that case  the tabs will form a carousel you can scroll left or right by using the left or right arrows that appear at the edges of the tab area.

            <Text>After a break, we decide to continue refining our story idea.  You need to reload the &quot;Danger Calls&quot; outline. Launch StoryCAD. 

 StoryCAD displays the File Open menu by default when launched,  and displays the last files you worked on the menu form. You can mouse over any of these files to see more details (like the file location.) If you haven’t edited the story you’re looking for in a while and it’s not on the list, Click the ‘Open story from disk’ button and browse for it. You can work on multiple story outlines in one StoryCAD session, but StoryCAD can only work with one story outline at a time. 

At this point we've recorded the initial story idea.  However, there's a great gulf between a story idea and a finished story.  At rare intervals, a story idea may spring forth so complete and well formed that it practically writes itself.  Most ideas, though, are fragments— a scene, a character, a situation (like this one), an ending, or something else.  The next step is to convert this fragment, this idea, into a concept.

In the literature of fiction writing, concept is a a term which is often misused and misunderstood; it’s conflated with ‘story idea’ and ‘premise’ and ‘theme’. If you think of a fiction writing workflow, it’s clear that there’s an intermediate step between story idea and premise. That’s concept. Larry Brooks, in his book Story Engineering, defines it this way: ‘A concept is an idea that asks a question that implies conflict.’  

Click on the Concept tab on your Story Overview and you’ll see this:

#


The note displayed is called a ToolTIp, and you’ll find many of these in StoryCAD. It will be replaced with your text as soon as you start keying into the text box.

Writing is thinking, and asking questions is at the core of critical thinking. Think of your concept as framed in the form of a question (or questions). The answer to that question is your story. If the question implies conflict, it’s a potentially effective story. 

Brooks offers the following example: a story idea might be to write a story about ballet dancers. A concept might be ‘What if a ballet dancer looses her leg at the knee but perseveres against great prejudice to become a professional dancer?’

For the “Danger Calls” concept, let’s use this:
 
#


(Don’t forget to save.) 

One nice thing about a question is that it can be refined by subsequent questions. A concept question often leads to other questions; The term ‘high concept’ is often used to describe a concept that will appeal to a wide audience, and is often a concept with broad possibilities. The da Vinci Code is an outstanding example of this.

But questions can also be used to refine and test concepts and many other store elements. StoryCAD contains a tool, Key Questions, for just  this purpose. 

Launch Key Questions from the Tool menu (use the wrench icon on the Menu Bar.) With Story Overview selected in the ComboBox, click Next Question until you find the first Concept question:

#


Key Questions can help you refine any story element or workflow step.

As is discussed in the Story Elements and Tabs topics in the Quick Start, a story outline is a collection of story elements organized below a Story Overview root node. These nodes are orthogonal to each other in the sense that they’re separate and independent, but they’re also interrelated. For example, a Scene node has a cast of Character nods and a location (a Setting node.)  

We can continue to work on the &quot;Danger Calls&quot; concept from any direction, adding Problem, Setting, or  Scene story elements, but let's start with something implicit in our Concept, some key characters.  Outlines are built by aggregation, adding bits and pieces as they occur to you, or as you reason things out. As a 'cops and robbers' story,  “Danger Calls”  has two obvious character archetypes, cop and criminal. Right-click on the Character Folder. You’ll see a ‘fly-out menu’ open:

#

The icons to the left of the first separator represent different story element types, and clicking on one of them will insert that as a child of the node you right-clicked. Click on the Character icon (if you want to know what a button is, just mouse over it.) You’ll insert a ‘New Character’ Character story element under the empty Characters folder. Click on the ‘New Character’ node and give your character a name. We also know the role we want, so pick that:

#

Give him the Story Role of Protagonist and move him to the characters folder.

We can also add a second character, the bad guy, the same way: 

#

You can set him as the Antagonist.

Notice that the list of roles doesn’t have an entry for Drug Dealer, so this was just keyed in. Most StoryCAD controls have lists of possible entries, but these lists are intended to be suggestions, not limitations. You can key whatever you want into most of these fields.

While we’re at it, let’s add a third character, another detective who’s a partner to Leonard. We’ll give him the name Tony Irwin.

#

Why a third character? There’s no concrete reason at this point in the outline’s development, but policemen often work in teams. Besides, with two detectives, there’s somebody to talk to. At some point in the story we’re likely to need to narrate events, to explain what’s going on and to develop plans of action. ‘Buddy’ roles are good for that. And if we don’t need Tony, a touch of the Delete button can always get rid of him.

At this point all three characters are stick figures, just names and roles. But that’s okay, we’re making progress.

Remember to save your work frequently.

            <Title>Plotting with StoryCAD</Title>
            <Text>Using StoryCAD to Plot Your Story


Storytelling with Purpose

A story is written as a sequence of scenes (in StoryCAD, Scene story elements.) A scene is an event, and the events are causally related: one event causes, and leads to, the next. For example:

The Queen is told by her mirror that Show White is now the fairest in the land, 
so she orders her huntsman to murder Show White and bring her the child’s heart,                     
but Show White pleads for her life, 
            so The huntsman spares Show White, abandoning her in the woods,
            and he tricks the Queen by bringing her the heart of a wild boar.

Coming up with these scenes is an act of imagination- it’s storytelling, play acting, in which you take on the part of one character and then the other.

In the previous topic Plotting In Scenes, we introduced the idea that every scene must advance the story’s plot: it must move toward the resolution of the story problem it’s a piece of.  This is another way of saying that every scene must have a purpose: show the Ordinary World, introduce the problem, resolve the conflict. A scene can and usually does have more than one purpose, but  must always contribute toward solving the Problem  it’s a part of; otherwise, the story will meander aimlessly. A plotted story must aim toward its outcome as an arrow flies towards its target. Think of each story problem as having structure, of consisting of plot points or story beats. Each plot point is a potential scene, and the plot point’s function is that scene’s purpose.

Scene Count (Story Length)

A frequent concern when plotting at the scene level is story length, which can be rephrased as ‘How many scenes do I need?’ As with many writing questions, this one has more than one answer. 

You can estimate your scene count by dividing your target story (novel, short story, script) word length (or playing time) divided by the average scene word count (or playing time.) If you’re writing a novel and shooting for 100,000-120,000 words, and your scenes average 2,000 words, you’ll need 50-60 scenes. In terms of three-act structure, a quarter of them might go to Act I, a  half to Act II, and the remaining quarter to Act III.

Finding Scenes

How do you go about finding those 50-60  (or however many you need) scenes?  

Don’t think in terms of scene count. Think of plotting as finding the scenes you need to resolve your story’s problems.  If you’ve been following this dialog, you know that you  have a top-level problem, the Story Problem, defined on the Story Overview form, and you’ve summarized the problem in its Premise:

#
 When that problem is resolved, the story is finished. This is the top level design of your story.

If you were to use Master Plots to create of Scene story elements for the plot points in this problem with the Three Act Structure template, it might look like this:

#

This is what plotting the main Story Problem might look like if it were, say, a short story. But it’s longer story (a Novella, in this case), and there aren’t enough scenes to carry the longer work. So instead of thinking of each part as  a scene, consider it just as a story beat or plot point. Ignoring the other plot points, consider First Obstacle and Subsequent Obstacles not as Scenes but as Problems= subproblems, Complications, in this case):

#

In real life one strategy to solve a problem is to decompose it into smaller problems. That same approach works when plotting, the twist being that you’ll be creating rather than solving subproblems. Don’t plot in Scenes;  plot in Problems. These problems can be further decomposed into scenes:

#

This process works not only with complications (subplots with bad outcomes which are designed to increase the conflict), but with other subplots. In The Old Man and the Sea, Manolin, the boy Santiago mentored and who loves him, has a character arc based on his relationship with the old man:

#

This is an inner problem for Manolin, a coming of age arc, and it’s plotted in just six scenes:

#

Hemingway uses this problem as a frame around Santiago’s battle, splitting the scenes and using the first three to introduce Santiago before his battle, and the last three to show Manolin vowing to fish with the old man again. Plot your scenes for your Problems, but you don’t have to arrange them in that order in your narrative. That’s what Story Narrator View is for.

Eliminating Scenes 

A quite different answer to the ‘How many scenes?’ question is ‘As few as possible’, following Robert Heinlein’s adage: “The most important lesson in the writing trade is that any manuscript is improved if you cut away the fat.” Or, if you prefer, William Faulkner’s: “In writing, you must kill your darlings.”

The urge will be to create a scene for every plot point.  But you have a wonderful tool at your disposal, your reader’s imagination. If you can remove a scene and the reader can follow your story line, that thing can and should be cut.</Text>

            <Text>Plotting Tools

StoryCAD comes with three tools to help you plot your story.

MasterPlots

In recent decades, the three-act structure has been joined by a bevy of other story structures, with different plot points:  Dan Wells’ Seven Point Structure, The Hero’s Journey, Blake Snyder’s Save the Cat, and many more.  Since plot points are also called story beats, these structures are often called ‘beat sheets’. A beat sheet can serve as a sort of plot template. StoryCAD’s Master Plots tool provides a number of these templates, which will insert a set of Scene story elements into your outline at the place of your choosing:

#


Since every Problem is a ‘small story’ and has its own set of events that define it, a Problem is good place to use this tool. A Problem can be thought of as a sequence, a term used frequently in scriptwriting, which is defined as ‘a series of scenes with a beginning, middle, and end.’ Or, if you prefer, setup, development, and resolution. 

Here’s what using the Three Act Play will do if you add it after a problem:

#

These are not scene summaries; it’s up to you to outline the scene itself, and the process will be described a little later. These are plot points, or story beats.  Master Plots populates the template scene’s Notes tab with what should happen at that point in the template. The actual scenes might start off like this:

#

StoryCAD won’t create these scenes for you (although the next topic, Plotting with StoryCAD, can help you. For help in how to do so, MasterPlots  created one Scene story element for each plot point, which suggests that a scene can do only one thing. That’s far from the truth; a scene can and usually should do multiple things: introduce or develop character, advance the plot, etc. The Scene story element’s Development tab contains a field, Purpose of Scene, which includes many of these purposes (not surprisingly related to the Notes in a Scene generated by MasterPlots.) Purpose of Scene is different from most controls in that you can check off multiple purposes. 

Dramatic Situations

The Dramatic Situations tool, based on Polti’s and Figgis’ books (both titled The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations), lists a set of situations with roles in opposition and uncertain outcomes- which is to say, situations with built-in drama and conflict:

#

Although the world has changed greatly since Polti’s 1895 book,  the situations remain relevant, because they’re very  human situations. Mike Figgis recommends using loose rather than literal interpretations of the situations. He points out that these 36 situations work for both outer and inner problems and at varied scales: Disaster, one of the situations, ‘can be a war or an earthquake or the sinking of the Titanic’, but also  ‘in a more intimated love story, it could be a case of unrequited love, the loved one marries another person, a personal disaster of the highest magnitude.’

StoryCAD’s adjusts to scale by allowing you to select a dramatic situation as either a Problem or a Scene story element:

#

Frequently, a Dramatic Situation is both Problem and Scene (usually the climax.). For example: courtroom drama is a case of Supplication, and in To Kill a Mockingbird,  Atticus Finch’s defense of Tom Robinson is the Story Problem and the courtroom scene (but not the climax.) Basing the central story problem on a Dramatic Situation s is discussed at length in Story Structure Architect, by Victoria Schmidt (Writer’s Digest Books, 2005.) And of course any Problem can be thought of as a sequence, a series of scenes.  Stories are in a sense recursive: A story’s Story Problem can decompose into a series of Problems, each of which is a smaller story with its own setup, complication, and resolution. In turn, each Problem can be decomposed into a sequence, a series of Scenes, each of which is also a little story, typically with setup, complication, and resolution. And in fact, scene outcomes and problem outcomes are often complications for the story problem, with bad endings making things worse for the protagonist.

Mike Figgis suggests a different use for the Dramatic Situations: as an aid when you’re stuck in constructing a plot. Pick one of the 36 situations at random and insert it at the place where you’re stuck. As he puts it, “Chance has always been my friend.”

Stock Scenes

Another StoryCAD tool, Stock Scenes, lists a number of categories of scenes:

#

Each of these categories contains a number of scenes examples:

#

Unlike Dramatic Situations, this tool works just with Scenes. One use is to help develop Master Plot plot points / story beats. For example,  the Climatic Moments category can suggest Resolution examples, Ticking Clocks can suggest scenes that ratchet up drama, Obstacles to the Chase (or Discovery, or Romance) can be a Pinch Point, and so forth. As with all examples, if you use it, own it, make it yours. Be specific.

            <Text>Website Form
The website form allows you store and view web pages easily and functions like a 			smaller version of your web browser. The URL you’re browsing is kept in the form.

#

These buttons allow you to refresh, go forwards and respectively.
#

#

This is the search bar, if you have a website link (URL) then you can paste it here and 		after clicking the search button it will load the website. Conversely if you don’t have a 		URL you can search a query such as a map of the world and it will search it using 
Google.

Example -  Planning out a fictional character.

1) Create a new website node, you can do this by right clicking a node and  then clicking then clicking the webpage icon (ALT + W).

#

2) Now navigate to it by clicking on it, it should now look similar the picture below.

#

3) Now lets make a fictional map, so search below fictional map generator.

#

3) Select any website below, for this example we will use the first one.

#

We have now got a map of our fictional word and can start planning our story around this fictional world.

Note: The Website Form requires the Microsoft Edge WebView 2 runtime, most 		Windows computers will already have this installed by default however if you are for any reason missing it, StoryCAD will ask to install it for you.

The File Menu button displays a drop-down menu of file options:

#


A StoryCAD outline is a single file with a file extension of .stbx: for instance, ‘The Maltese Falcon.stbx.’   A StoryCAD file can be moved, copied, etc.
 
The Open command identifies which outline you wish to work on. The Save command will save the file with the same name it with which it was opened or previously saved. The Save As command will save an outline under a new name or at a new location. 

File Open displays the following open dialog:

#

This dialog will by default display recently opened outlines. Clicking on Open story from disk will open a file browser to allow you to pick a particular outline to pen.  Clicking on the Create new story tab on the left will display a dialog for a new story outline. The Project path defaults to the file folder specified in Preferences.

#
 
Clicking on Sample Stories on the left tab displays a list of sample outlines installed with StoryCAD for you to play with. If you intend to change a sample, we recommend saving it to a different location before doing so.

Only one story outline can be open at a time.  If you open a new file you'll be prompted to save the current file first if it’s been modified.

            <Synopsis>TUTOR07</Synopsis>
            <Text>The characters, so far, have been defined by their roles; the only specific traits we've given them (Leonard and Tony) have been shaped by the story's needs.  It's time to put some flesh on these skeletons.

Let's start with Charlie Lacas.  We know a few things about him.  He's young, he deals drugs, and he uses technology that the detectives don't have.  That absence of technology suggests that the story doesn't take place in a big city.  But perhaps Charlie is a city boy who's figured out that he can use his supplier contacts in New York to deal drugs in a smaller city, say in upstate New York somewhere.   It's safer, the competition is less, and he has an edge over the small-town cops.   This implies that he's fairly bright, which makes him a more worthy adversary for our detectives.

Going to his Character form, we can start creating some of this, starting with the Role tab:

#


We then turn to Psychological considerations:

#

Personality Type is based on the theory of enneagrams (see &quot;Personality Type&quot; under &quot;Psychology Tab&quot; in the &quot;Characters&quot; chapter  of this manual for more about enneagrams.)   A stereotype such as this can suggest how the character might react in certain situations.  

Let's also define some Social tab factors:

#

The goal of all of this is to create a fully rounded human being, one who is believable and who you can visualize talking and acting in your story. 

The other major consideration is that the character should support the role you've given him.  Had the initial story idea been for a character, you might have fleshed the character out before you started looking for story problems, and then looked for a role to fit the character, but in this case the role came first and the character should fit the part.

We'll look at one last tab, the Backstory tab:

#

There's always a question of how much detail to provide, for characters, problems, settings, etc.  The answer will vary from story to story.  For example, this is an action-oriented story, so the characterizations aren't quite as important.  Whether or not they make it to your writing, the more you know about your characters the better.

Use this note area to describe your character's looks, style of dress and movement, and the impression he leaves.  


#


Some writers  will select a photograph of someone which they use when describing the character's appearance.  You and your readers should be able to visualize the character as though he were a real person.

In writing plays, where the characters must be cast, try to avoid writing dialog or situations which describe the characters more than necessary.  The producer will cast the part from available actors and actresses, and too detailed a description makes this task more difficult.

            <Text>GENERAL NON-FICTIONAbout This TemplateWhen compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format used for many types of non-fiction. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an EPUB or Kindle ebook.How To Use This TemplateInside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.Create a new text document for each section inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, sections will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format, or with a blank line for other formats.)If you don’t require a foreword, move the “Foreword” document to the Trash folder. Alternatively, rename it “Preface” or “Introduction” if you prefer.“Notes” and “Ideas” folders have been provided for your convenience, although you can replace them or create different top-level folders for your research materials if necessary (these are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature).Tables and FiguresIf you need to use tables or figures in your manuscript, you can label them using the following tags, replacing “KEYWORD” with a unique word that identifies your table or figure.!fig(KEYWORD)!table(KEYWORD)These tags will be replaced with numbers in the compiled document, with the numbering stream for figures being separate from the numbering stream for tables.You can refer to such tags as follows:#fig(KEYWORD)#table(KEYWORD)Here’s an example:Table !table(sales): Sales 2011Table !table(dates): Shipment datesFigure !fig(skeleton): The skeleton of the gnu.Figure !fig(malcolmreynolds): The second coolest character in Firefly.… (For sales figures, see table #table(sales))… For shipment dates, see table #table(dates)… where he discovered the skeleton of a gnarled gnu (see figure #fig(skeleton))… Chronicles providing a similar role, albeit without the Castle actor (see figure #fig(malcolmreynolds)).In the compiled document, the above text would look like this:Table 1: Sales 2011Table 2: Shipment datesFigure 1: The skeleton of the gnu.Figure 2: The second coolest character in Firefly.… (For sales figures, see table 1)… For shipment dates, see table 2… where he discovered the skeleton of a gnarled gnu (see figure 1)… Chronicles providing a similar role, albeit without the Castle actor (see figure 2).CompilingTitle pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder. Different front matter is used for different formats.A “Back Matter” folder is also provided. Here you can add any back matter that is specific to each Compile format. Currently this only contains documents for storying endnotes (see below).Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference panel and have it open alongside the Compile panel if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.To compile to standard manuscript format:Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use information from Contacts).To create your table of contents:Holding down the Command key, select all the documents you wish to be included in the contents listing. (Usually this will be “Foreword” and all chapter folders, but not the individual sections inside chapter folders. If you have footnotes and wish them to be added to the end of the manuscript as endnotes, you should also include the “Endnotes” document inside “Back Matter”.)Go to Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as ToC.Paste into the “Contents” document in the “Manuscript Format” front matter folder. (Tip: Use Format &gt; Font &gt; Underline to change or remove the dotted underline between the chapter names and page numbers.)The resulting linked text and page number tags will be replaced with the final chapter names and page numbers in the compiled document.Note that you don’t need to do this every time you compile, only when chapters have been added, deleted, renamed or moved around. (Note to Microsoft Word users: If you export to Word, you may need to generate a print preview in Word to force the page numbers to show up correctly - they may appear as question marks before doing so.)You don’t have to use “Copy Documents as ToC” to create a table of contents, by the way. You could equally construct one yourself using document links and placeholders - see “List of All Placeholders…” in the Help menu for more information on the latter.Go to File &gt; Compile…Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.Select either “Non-Fiction Manuscript (Courier)” or “Non-Fiction Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left.Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)If you have footnotes in your text, they can either be included at the end of each page (the default) or as endnotes. To have them included as endnotes:Beneath the list of documents on the right side of the Compile pane, tick “Add back matter”. This will include the “Endnotes” document from the Back Matter/Manuscript Format folder.Click on the gear icon in the right-most header bar in Compile.Tick “Export inspector footnotes as endnotes” and “Export inline footnotes as endnotes”.Click on “Compile”.•	To compile to paperback PDF format:Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.Follow the instructions under compiling for standard manuscript format for creating a table of contents, but this time paste the contents list into the Front Matter/Paperback/Contents document.Go to File &gt; Compile…Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.Select “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81”)” from the list of formats on the left.Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it if it. (This has already been set up for you.)If you have footnotes in your text, they can either be included at the end of each page or as endnotes. See the instructions under compiling for standard manuscript format for information on how to include footnotes as endnotes (in this case, however, clicking “Add Back Matter” will include the “Paperback” back matter folder).Click on “Compile”.To compile to ebook format:Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.Import a cover image (preferably in JPG or PNG format).You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels, based on Amazon’s recommended size and proportions for a Kindle cover at the time this template was created.Go to File &gt; Compile…From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.To create an ePub file, choose the “ePub 3” format.To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle KF8/Mobi” format.“ePub 2” and “Kindle Mobi” are older versions of the formats. They are mainly provided for supporting projects created in older versions of Scrivener.Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.Click on “Compile”.Adding Sub-HeadsIf you want your chapters divided into sections that each have their own sub-headings, simply use blank file groups for each heading, with each section under that heading a subdocument of the file group, like this:#Customising the Ebook Table of ContentsWhen exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.Name the document “Contents”.In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Command to select more than one document).For a simple flat list, hit Cmd-C or use Edit &gt; Copy. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, go to Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List.Click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Cmd-V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.If you intend to export to an older ebook format (ePub 2 or non-KF8 Mobi), select all of the text and change it to use a 12-point font.If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”. Now, when you Compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.Sample DocumentSee the “Sample MS” PDF file in the Research folder for an example of a document that has been created using this template.Final NoteScrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to non-fiction authors. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

 Backstory is what happened to your character before the story. It’s usually introduced as explanation  for traits or beliefs- as the root of a character’s motivations or reactions to story situations.

Backstory deserves caution for two reasons, however. If you’re shoehorning explanations for your character’s behavior into backstory, it can easily feel contrived. Also, it’s not easy to reveal backstory as your story unfolds. It’s a major cause of the dreaded ‘data dump.’</Text>

            <Text>Important Notice to StoryCAD Users

As the creators of StoryCAD, we're committed to offering a robust tool that aids fiction writers in planning and outlining their novels with ease. However, it's essential to understand the specific applications and limitations of StoryCAD to minimize data loss or inconvenience.

**Understanding StoryCAD's Scope:**
 While StoryCAD supports RTF (rich field text) for detailed note-taking and outlining, it can’t replace a full-featured word processor. Our application focuses on the structure and planning phase of your writing. It is *not* meant to serve as your primary tool for manuscript writing. It’s missing standard word processor features like font selection, rich section, paragraph and word styles, etc., and, more importantly, doesn’t support editing multiple documents simultaneously or breaking a large document into smaller sections. 

**Recommended Word Processing Integration:**
For drafting and preserving your novel's manuscript, we recommend using established word processing software. StoryCAD seamlessly integrates with Scrivener, a comprehensive tool for writers that supports extensive manuscript management and editing features. Our interface complements Scrivener, allowing split-screen editing where you view the outline while writing your draft. 
StoryCAD is also compatible with widely used word processors like Microsoft Word and Google Docs. We generate reports you can import into these tools, allowing you to reference your outline but still take full advantage of each tool's strengths in your writing journey.

**Protecting Your Work:**
To ensure the security of your manuscript, please use a dedicated word processing application for drafting and storing your novel. By doing so, you'll not only protect your work but also maximize StoryCAD's potential as an outliner. These mainstream programs are inherently more stable than our app, which is relatively new and has a much smaller user base (and development staff.)

**StoryCAD's Backup and Autosave Features:** 
To enhance your experience and safeguard your work, StoryCAD includes built-in backup options and an Autosave feature. Our two backup options periodically save your outlines and notes, reducing the risk of data loss. Meanwhile, the Autosave function works silently in the background, automatically saving your progress as you work. These features are part of our commitment to providing a reliable and user-friendly platform for your creative process. We understand the challenges and setbacks that come with losing valuable work. Our commitment is to minimize this risk and to help you integrate StoryCAD into your workflow in the most effective manner.



Thank you for choosing StoryCAD as a companion in your writing endeavors. We look forward to reading or viewing the incredible stories you'll create.</Text>

Structural Sources of Conflict (eolss.net) 
The 8 causes of conflict (and what to do about them) | by Duane Rohrbacher | Medium 
The Relevance of Clausewitz's Theory of War to Contemporary Conflict Resolution (jstor.org) 

Take a look at this last one (‘8 causes’) against the categories I have. For example, ‘Policy’ may automatically point to structural issues.

Clausewitz describes war as “…a clash between major interests, which is resolved by bloodshed – that is the only way in which it differs from other conflicts.” 

The issue of information warfare

When it comes to an extremely important point, the morality of war, Clausewitz says: “the moral factor is the most fluid element of all, and therefore spreads most easily to affect everything else.”  9 

Warfare is “Trinitarian.” Simply put, it is about people, armed forces, and government. 12 

These dynamics are also part of a new strategic landscape of conflict. Traditionally, violent conflict has been associated with inter-state wars or civil wars, but there is increasing agreement among conflict analysts that most current violent conflicts do not fit these ‘traditional’ categories. For instance, most violent deaths occur in non-traditional conflict settings. The new landscape of conflict frequently involves a mix of ingredients such as local and cross-border organized crime, socio-economic exclusion, rapid urbanization, political change after years of stasis, or long-standing disputes over land or identity. 
Something for Everyone in the Military-Industrial Complex | War Is Boring 
This is another rabbit hole. But a very interesting one. 
‘It turns out that all the advising and assisting, all the training and coaching, has only made matters worse. As for those overstretched forces, relentless deployments are evidently breaking them down as reports indicate that rates of mental distress and suicide are again on the rise among them.’

Story Problem

Your story can (and usually will) have more than one Problem. Every Problem has a Premise, but only one of your Problem story elements is the Story Problem. It’s the spine of your story; when it’s resolved, your story is over. Select one of your  Problem pages from the drop-down list as the ‘Story Problem’ (here, ‘Hamlet wants to avenge his father’s murder’.)

Premise

The Premise field on the Story Overview form is a read-only copy of the Premise field on the selected Story Problem’s Resolution tab.  Every Problem can contain a Premise, and you would do well to create one for each problem.

            <Synopsis>TUTOR09</Synopsis>
            <Text>We know how our story starts and how it ends; we're left with the middle story that ties these two parts together.

We need to figure out how the two detectives can find out where the next drug deal is to be held.  One way is to enlist an ally who knows all about wireless communications.  Let's say he's the owner of a small radio-electronics shop.  But as with the interplay between Leonard and Tony, we need conflict.  Let's make this character a reluctant ally, one who's coerced into helping our protagonists.  We might make him a petty criminal of some sort, for instance, and have Leonard threaten or blackmail him.  That fits Leonard's character as we know it: he'll go to any lengths to catch Lacas.  Let's call our new character Joe Edwards. For his crime, we need something serious enough to get him into trouble, but not too serious, or the reader will be outraged that Leonard's left him on the street.  Let's say that he's used his electronics skills to bug the people in the apartment where he lives;  and in particular, the single woman who lives downstairs— he's a Peeping Tom.  We can also add the scene where Kraskin threatens Edwards with arrest and exposure unless he cooperates.

#
1

We've also gotten rid of the rest of the scaffolding plot points; we know where we're going now and don't need additional directions.  The Dramatic Situations entry (had we used it) would have been 'Obtaining (through force)'. 

The question now turns to what Edwards will provide our detectives to enable them to eavesdrop on Lacas' cellular phone.   This is the place where some research might be useful, to make the story more believable.  However, we'll just have Edwards pull out a modified scanner and key Lacas' phone number, which the detectives provide.  This gizmo will be our detectives' 'listening post' and will let them overhear anything the drug dealer says on the phone.  We'll add a plot point for this, although technically it's a continuation of the preceding scene. 
 
It's vital, when plotting, to keep the readers in mind, and to think about what will keep them turning pages. This particular plot point isn't too dramatic, but it does have appeal to curiosity.  We can spice this up further by having Tony remind Lacas of the laws they're breaking.

We've developed two story problems.  The first or external problem is the one we just gave the reader— the setup or first act.  We've also just resolved this problem, by giving the detectives the means to eavesdrop Lacas.   The second problem, based on Leonard's impulsiveness, has him captured by Lacas, and we'll want the reader to know if Tony can rescue him.  The second problem provides us with a complication, the capture.  We could therefore look at the middle story as a way to leapfrog from the one story problem to the other.  Since a story problem is a sort of story in miniature (so is a scene), plotting will frequently involve working this way; see &quot;Plotting and the Problem form&quot; for more details.

Let's look for a way to get Leonard captured.  Turning once more to the Tools menu, we select Stock Scenes from the Plotting Aids sub-menu.  Several further choices appear.  Let's look at the Twists and Turns choice. 

 This provides us with a number of stock scenes which offer dramatic twists: 


#

In this case the first twist listed might help us; our electronics buff ally, Joe Edwards, could be tied to Lacas in some fashion and tip him off that the two detectives are listing in on his call.   Lacas could then set the cops up.  We decide to go with this.  Clicking on the first item in the list, and then on the Copy button, adds this stock scene into our plot outline.


#

We can change the scene summary to read 'Edwards has tipped Lacas, who traps Kraskin.'  

There's something missing, a piece in which the detectives overhear the Charlie Lacas setting up a drug deal, and which leads Leonard to rush impulsively into the ambush.  But why would Leonard rush to catch Lacas and leave his partner behind?

We know that our detectives are using an illegal bug to catch Lacas, so they can't implicate their boss or other cops in their quest.  It's just the two of them.  The two of them might have decided to take turns on an unoffical stake out.  That way we can have Leonard working the stake out when the deal goes down.

So let's add a plot point immediately prior to this where this takes place, and title it 'Leonard, on stake out, learns of a drug deal .'  We can add notes to explain the details of the stake out.

Our plot outline now looks like this:

This is a relatively complete plot.  We could sit down and start writing the story now, but that would be a mistake.  There's a lot left unfinished: we haven't created settings, the characters are still unrefined, etc.  The more these things are worked out, the richer and more complete the first draft will be when you write it. 

We should evaluate our work so far.  The creation of the story outline is an excellent time to review and revise.  For one thing, changes at this point in the story's development, while it's still just an outline, are relatively cheap and easy; you're not sacrificing prose and dialog that took time and effort to produce.  There's also another advantage: at this point you're looking only at the structure of the story.  Every story has these components of problems, characters, setting and plot; but once you begin to write, the bones will be fleshed out in narrative and dialog and dressed with your writing style.  The naked structure will be, in a sense, hidden by the prose. This makes spotting and correcting structural problems more difficult. 

StoryCAD offers a tool, Key Questions, to assist in refining and testing your story elements.  There are questions for Story, Problem, Character, Setting, and Plot.  From the Tools menu, select Key Questions and then Story Questions.  A form displaying a series of questions for the overall story will appear.  We can test the story concept against these questions.  If one is worth further study, notes can be recorded in the Answer section.  For example, scrolling through the questions, we find:
#

5


The second part of the question is a good one; we haven't selected a market, and therefore don't know if the story will match slant, length requirements, etc.

It's a good idea to use Key Questions frequently while creating the concept, and to review them before going on to the draft.

In this tutorial we've produced most of a story outline.  We've worked through problem refinement, created several characters, drafted a plot, and along the way we've examined several tools to help these processes.  The story outline was created as this tutorial was being written, exactly as shown. We feel that any story idea can be converted into a fully developed concept using these techniques. 

&quot;Danger Call&quot;  is a action-oriented suspense tale and stresses plot over character development.  A character-driven story would be developed in much the same way, but the character profiles and relationships would, of course, developed more fully before developing the plot.

If you have cloned StoryCAD to a separate repo and built it for the first time then you may be surprised to see this screen. It indicates a key file related to licensing is missing from your local clone. These licenses are in effect for the storybuilder.org repo only. The missing licenses won’t cause any issues with the app functioning, but your copy won’t report errors via Elmah.io and you may see pops relating to syncfusion licensing errors.
Regardless, congratulations on successfully compiling StoryCAD.

If StoryCAD notices you have a debugger attached to the process, the developer menu will appear.
This shows info about the computer and may contain buttons to test some parts of the StoryCAD.
If running without a keyfile (which is standard for those contributing to the StoryCAD project.) then some of these buttons may not work or cause intended behavior.

As such this menu may be removed, updated or abandoned at any point.

Developer Notes
- Single Instancing whilst debugging in VS does work however the window may not be brought to the front and may only flash as VS will attempt to hide it again if it wasn’t shown, to test Single Instancing releated stuff do the following:
	- Run the app in VS (or Deploy.) so that it installs the app on your system.
	- Close the app.
	- Now launch the app from elsewhere (Such as the start menu or taskbar)
	- Hide the app behind other windows or minimise it
	- Attempt to launch the app again
	- The first instance of the app should now be brought on top of all the window

            <Text>Creating a Story



The best  way to learn about StoryCAD is to actually create a story with it.  That's what this tutorial is for.  We'll create a story outline with StoryCAD and show you exactly what we did at each step along the way. We don’t claim it’s a great outline; actually, it’s pretty trite. But the point is that any story idea, with work and process, can be developed into a workable story.

The tutorial assumes you can navigate in StoryCAD, so if you haven’t yet done so, please take a look at the Quick Start  section of this manual, and particularly at the Navigating in StoryCAD subsection. That  said, let’s begin.

Every story starts with an idea. The idea might come from anywhere.  A conversation might lead to a bit of dialog; someone you see in a crowd could suggest an interesting character; a newspaper article or story you're read or movie you've seen might spark an idea for a conflict.  

Our idea started with a television news piece which showed young gang members, boys as young as fourteen, selling drugs on the street.  We were stricken by the image of these young criminals using technology such as disposable cell phones, and thought there was a story in there someplace.

Regardless of where the idea comes from or how complete it is, at the moment of conception it’s all you have, and it’s a good idea to capture it lest you lose it. That’s why it’s a good idea to jot those ideas down when they occur in some form: in a notebook, or on your phone. 

To do so in StoryCAD, launch the program. The first time you launch the program, you’ll be prompted to your update your user preferences. One option is your Project directory. Although StoryCAD remembers and displays your last outline location, this value is its default starting location.  You should also set your backup options. 

Back to our story idea. Use the File menu’s  Open/Create file option:

#

Click on Create New Story to start a new outline:

#

Select ‘Folders’ for the Template. If it’s not already there, change the Project path to the folder you’d like to save your outline in (usually the Preferences location) using the Browse button. And finally, assign a Project Name. This will be the file name of the story outline file. In our case, use ‘Danger Calls’. Click on Create project, and you’ll have created your first story outline:

#

Note the green pencil on the Status Bar at the bottom of the page. The green indicates that the story outline has been saved to disk:

 #

Click on the  Story Overview node in the navigation pane:

#

The content pane will show this node’s (empty) tabs and be sitting on the empty Story Idea tab:

#

You can click on any of the tabs to display that tab’s contents.

You'll notice that the Author, Date Created and Last Changed fields are already filled in.  The author's name is taken from your name as entered in Preferences. For a new outline, Date Created is today's date, and for a new or old outline, and Last Changed is the computer date on which a change to the outline was last made. 

Key whatever notes you like regarding your idea. While we're here, we might as well fill out a few other items. 

At the moment, the story outline for &quot;Danger Calls&quot; exists only in your computer's memory, but isn’t saved to disk.  Let's save what we've done so far.  We recommend you save your work frequently, and provide a number of ways to do so.  The simplest is to click on the status bar’s Changed Indicator:

#

The indicator will change from red to green, indicating that all changes have been saved to disk.

#

Alternatively, from the File menu, you can select Save Story, or enter the Ctrl+S shortcut keys.  Remember to save your work periodically.

As we said in the beginning, an idea can come form anywhere: a bit of dialog, a possible character, a subject from an article or another story. You want to capture as much of that as possible. If it’s a character or a bit of dialog, create a Character story element. If it’s a location or situation, create a Setting story element. if it’s an event, create a Scene story element. If it’s a newspaper article or story you’ve read or movie you seen, describe it on the Story Idea tab. Encourage and trust your muse: whatever it was that made you think ‘story’, save it. For now, for “Danger Calls”, we don’t have any of these, just the idea as recorded.

This is a good place to talk about workflow. Workflow is discussed more fully in Writing with StoryCAD, but the idea’s pretty simple. Your story outline is comprised of a number of story elements, and each story element is organized as one or more tabs. Each tab focuses on one aspect of the story element. A story outline always contains and starts with one story element, the Story Overview, and so far you’ve filled in one tab, the Story Idea. Every story starts with a story idea, and recording it is the first step in your workflow.

Click on the Danger Calls node’s Structure tab. As is described in the Quick Start, this tab is concerned with constraints on the order and form you place on your story, and contains a number of user interface controls for this purpose. Our story idea’s about crime and criminals, so let’s pick a genre for that. Clicking on the down-arrow key on the Genre ComboBox will display a list of choices; we’ll choose Suspense.  Set Type to Short Story (to keep our example brief.) StoryCAD has many drop-down lists. Not all lists are editable, but for the most part they’re not exhaustive, and  are editable: you can enter values other than the provided options. The lists are examples, suggestions; they’re not there to limit your creativity, but to encourage it. 

 #


The Structure tab on the Story Overview is important not necessarily at the moment of conception, but early in story development, because it constrains other choices. Type affects story length and complexity, and Genre sets reader expectations: to be amused for a humor piece, to have a mystery to solve in a mystery, etc.

When you’re done with an editing session, you can Close your outline using the File Menu and open a different outline, or exit the program. Be sure to save your work.

            <Text>Defining Problems

In StoryCAD the Problem form is the key to creating an outline. You want to motivate your audience to keep reading or viewing your story, and Problems create suspense and tension through uncertain outcomes. 

StoryCAD’s Problem form is based on three  elements: Goal, Motivation, and Conflict, and is based on the book GMC: Goal, Motivation, and Conflict by Debra Dixon. The goal is what your character wants, the motivation is why they want it, and the conflict is what they’ll have to overcome to achieve the goal. Both your Protagonist and your Antagonist have their goals and motivations, and generally they are each other’s conflicts.
What makes GMC interesting is that it deals with the intersection of character and plot. The literature of the craft of writing often discusses the need for strong characters and of the need for good plots. GMC ties them together. Plot is the character's attempt to overcome the opposition and achieve the goal. The Problem form links to the problem’s protagonist and antagonist, which you must have defined as Character story elements. This leads you further down the wormhole towards fully developing your outline.
The Problem form’s tie to Character forms supports various approaches to story creation. You may start from an idea, concept or situation, and think of your problems more in terms of the events that must unfold (plot-oriented), or you may start from the conception of a character, and find that character’s problem. Your story needs both a plot and characters, and centering on your outline’s Problems can give you both.
Problems server a variety of roles in a story:
Story Problem

As was mentioned under Ideation, one problem is the Story Problem, the spine of the story. The Story Problem’s Protagonist is the Story’s main character. When the Story Problem is resolved, the story’s over.
Outer and Inner Problems

The story's action, the plot, comes from the external events which occur as the characters struggle to reach their goals.  Similarly, character growth and development occurs as characters struggle to reach their goals.  The difference is whether the problem is an outer one or an inner one. 

An outer problem is the character's struggle to achieve some physical goal— to solve a problem, to win the love of his life, to find a treasure.

An inner problem is some want or need within the character himself, a need to grow or change.  This problem may be some character flaw or psychological hurdle to overcome.  It may be the real reason why the character pursues his external goal, even though the superficial reason he gives is quite different.  The character frequently doesn't know that he has an inner problem at the start of the story, and sometimes, in tragic endings, refuses to acknowledge or resolve the inner problem.

It's often constructive to use StoryCAD to define both an external and an internal problem for your protagonist, with separate Problem forms for each  of them. Both problems help to shape the story's plot. There’s even a Create New Story template for this:

#

The outer problem asks 'what does the character want?'  The inner problem asks 'why does he want it?'  The outer problem is tangible. The inner problem is intangible, invisible.  The outer problem faces an external adversary.  The inner problem is Man against Himself, usually with something to decide or discover. The outer problem is solved when (win or loose) something is accomplished.  The inner problem is solved when the character grows or changes, or fails to do so.  The inner problem is related to theme. The two problems are connected because your protagonist must come to grips with his inner demon before he can solve the external, outer problem.
Conflict

While we often think we’d like to live our lives with a minimum of conflict, we’re fascinated by the stuff, and our fiction absolutely depends on it.  

Fictional conflict is easy to define: it’s what prevents your character from achieving his or her goal. Picking the right conflicts is arguably the most important decision you’ll make in designing your story. If there’s no struggle, there’s no story. Robert McKee puts it this way: Nothing moves forward in a story except through conflict.

Remember that conflict is only one third of the triangle of Problem. Goal and Motivation, for both your protagonist and antagonist, are equally important. 

Not all conflict will suit your needs. It’s easy to swing towards either of two directions.  At the one extreme is senseless violence, with Black Bart villains and a need for your hero to wear tights and a cape. At the other lies the absence of meaningful conflict, replaced with shallow conflicts which are easily resolved and lead to Pollyanna outcomes.  The right conflicts adds complexity and layers of meaning to your story. 
Crimes of passion and crimes of opportunity are different than the other types of crime. The legal definition of a crime of passion is that it’s committed ‘in a moment of passion’ in response to some provocation. We all known provocation, and have acted in ways we regret in response to provocation. It’s easy to see ourselves  committing  some crimes:  beating up a bully who ‘deserves it’ or the person who cuts us off in traffic. We can also all identify with someone stealing, in order to feed a starving child.
The other crime subcategories are different because they’re deliberate and premeditated. We somehow feel that they’re more organic, a part of the individual’s nature, and it’s interesting to note that those committing these other categories often have characteristics of narcissistic personality disorder. 
But it’s also worth noting that every one of us possess some basic traits of narcissism, such as being self-focused, having a lack of empathy, and desiring power and control, in one degree or another.  We are all potential criminals.
When thinking about conflict in your fiction, you may want to consider two things.

Likewise, solving a conflict doesn’t always resolve a story: if so, many of our novels would be short stories. One problem often leads to another (often less tractable) one. This is what makes The Old Man and The Sea such a beautifully plotted tale.
Complications

 Just as in real life,  one problem often leads to another.  These complications must be causally linked, just as scenes must be. Complications make things worse for your protagonist, escalate conflict, and build toward your story’s climax. 

A good example of this is found in Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea.  This novelette consists of three sections, each of which is a separate story problem.  In the first problem, the old Cuban fisherman hasn't caught a fish for over eighty days, and the Story Question is 'Will he catch a fish before he starves to death?'  After a struggle, he hooks a giant marlin.  The first problem is solved, but a second problem emerges:  the fish is so gigantic that catching it is doubtful; the Story Question is 'Can he catch the fish?'  After an epic battle he does kill the fish and secure it to the side of his small boat.  But a final story problem emerges when sharks appear and attack the fish.  The Story Question is 'Can the fisherman save his catch and bring the marlin safely to shore?'

Rather than arrange these problems in a list:

#

You may want arrange them as children of the original problem, which won’t be solved until the complications are:

#

Where possible, complications should be ordered to make things progressively worse for the protagonist. By the end of the shark attack, the marlin is nothing but a head and tail and skeleton; things can’t get much worse for Santiago.
Conflicts of start at one level and devolve into a more serious one: ‘it’s not a war until the guns start firing.’  Finding your way from inciting incident through middle story to climax is  the process of finding complications, and escalating conflicts is one approach to doing so.  The escalation can occur for many reasons: a character gets tipped over the edge, a ticking clock goes off, a secondary character does something rash, a dropped dish is mistaken for a gunshot.
Subplots

Complications and inner conflicts are two ways in which a story is made richer and more complex by containing more than one problem. A story can also contain problems distinct from the main story problem and which run parallel to it. These often center around characters other than the protagonist. 

A subplot may expand on a character relationship. Romance subplots are examples. The Character form’s Relationship tab explores a variety of possible relationships. The subplot will be one of inner conflict.

In The Old Man and the Sea, a subplot revolves around the relationship between the old man, Santiago, and the boy Manolin. Hemingway writes that Santiago, as mentor, had taught Manolin to fish, and that Manolin loved him. But  at the start of the story, we’re given clues that the relationship has changed:  Manolin now carries the old man’s net, and makes sure that he has enough to eat, while taking care to protect Santiago’s dignity. The subplot’s problem is that Manolin’s parents think Santiago is jinxed, unlucky, and have ordered Manolin to go out on a more prosperous boat. This information is presented at the start of the story, but Manolin’s problem isn’t resolved until the end, framing the old man’s battle with the sea, when Manolin tells Santiago that he’ll fish with the old man tomorrow, for he (Manolin) has much to learn. This character growth by Manolin resonates with Santiago’s epic battle with the Marlin and the sharks.

A subplot may explore or test the protagonist’s goal and motivation by comparison and contrast. One example is the ‘mirror’ subplot, a problem which is similar to the protagonist’s, but with a different outcome. Another is a ‘refusal of the call’ subplot in which a supporting character refuses to participate in your protagonist’s journey.

The one characteristic all subplots (and complications, and inner problems) must face is that they must relate and contribute to the Story Problem in some fashion. Otherwise, your audience will be left wondering why this strange story is embedded in your tale.

Problem Workflow
The Problem form contains four tabs:
Problem Tab

The problem tab identifies the problem in general, and frames it in the form of a question, the general shape of which is ‘Will the protagonist achieve his or her goal?’ In essence, it’s a summary of the problem.

Protagonist Tab 
Antagonist Tab

These two tabs are identical, and both contain all three GMC elements. What differs is the role: Protagonist is derived from a Greek word meaning the main actor (the ‘first actor’); Antagonist (from the Greek words ‘anti’ (against) and ‘agonist’ (actor), is the opposition or foil to the protagonist. Although many problems don’t have human adversaries for your Protagonist (Person vs. Nature, Person vs. Society, etc.), it’s usually a good idea to cast the opposition as a character, or perhaps to create a human character who personifies the opposition. 

The role of Protagonist is not about good or bad; it’s about ‘Whose story is it?’ Your protagonists can be and anti-hero, with few or no hero-like traits. He can even be a villain,  as in How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Dexter the serial killer, or Maleficent from the Sleeping Beauty retelling.

It’s important to understand that your Antagonist has his own Goal and Motivation, and his own Conflict: his opposition is your Protagonist. It’s been said that no man is a villain in his own eyes. That may or may not be true, but he will certainly have his reasons for his behavior, even if they’re rooted in abnormal psychiatry.  Of But a villain’s motive may be more relatable, rooted in greed, humiliation, pride, anger, or heartache.  A common characteristic of villains is that they’re in over their head: a small mistake grows larger over time.

StoryCAD includes a tool, Conflict Builder, which describers conflicts into categories and examples from the world of conflict resolution that go beyond creating a cardboard ‘bad guy’ adversary.
Resolution Tab

The resolution is the outcome of the problem. Outcomes can be generalized into 'successful' or 'not successful', but the choices listed for this story element are more useful.  They represent story patterns which recur throughout fiction.

The outcome is the actual results or end of the problem.  

The generalized outcomes are:


Protagonist
obtains goal
 The protagonist should be a sympathetic character with a worthwhile goal, who solves her problem through her own efforts.



Protagonist 
reaches decision
The sympathetic protagonist must decide between two courses of action.  The complications are from making the  wrong choice.  At the end she reverses and chooses correctly, leading to a happy ending.



Protagonist 
'comes to realize'
The initial situation has the protagonist feeling depressed, guilty or anxious.  The turning point results in her being made aware that things are not as bad as they seem.



Protagonist 
abandons goal
The sympathetic protagonist has a destructive goal such as revenge.  At the turning point he realizes that his goal is no good and abandons it.



Protagonist is rehabilitated
The protagonist is dominated by a negative trait.  The crisis shocks him into rehabilitation.  This outcome is common in confessionals.



Villain is foiled
('biter bit')
The protagonist must be a villain, with a goal which will have ruinous effects if achieved. bring disaster to a sympathetic goal.  The hero is the antagonist who opposes him, in a role reversal.  At the crisis, when things are darkest, the protagonist seems to win, but the outcome is a reversal to a defeat.



Protagonist 
declines morally
The protagonist must start with some good qualities and hope of a good outcome, but at the moment of crisis he declines.  The seeds of the negative trait which dooms him must be present from the start.



Protagonist is defeated
The sympathetic protagonist has a desirable goal, but is defeated in the end.  This is true tragedy.  The Conflict Type is often 'Person vs. Fate' or 'Person vs. Society.'



Villain is successful
Frequently the villain is a Trickster who succeeds through cleverness.  This outcome is common in comedies.



Protagonist fails to realize
The protagonist doesn't adapt to changes in the story situation due to denial or stubbornness.  A tragic ending of lesser drama.


The Method control on the Resolution tab of the Problem form identifies the means by which the protagonist tries to achieve his goal.  The examples are some of the methods used in many stories.

As with all story elements, the more specific, the better.  You might change 'Pleads for another chance'  with  'Pleads for a chance to fight Apollo Creed.'

Sequel Tab

#

The prose which immediately follows a scene usually ties that scene to the next.  The two literary devices which serve this purpose are the transition and the sequel.

A sequel is told from the viewpoint of the scene's protagonist and describes his reaction to the events in the scene.  The reaction follows a repeatable pattern.

Emotional Response	First there's an emotional response.  Since most scenes' outcomes are setbacks, this is frequently shock, disbelief, anger, etc.

Review and Thought	As the emotions ebb, the character will begin to reflect on the events in a more dispassionate and logical manner.  He may recall other and earlier information.  This period of review and thought is a good place to put back story.

New Goal		The period of thought leads to a new plan, by which the protagonist can overcome the setback of the previous scene.  This new goal is in turn the scene's goal for the next scene, which propels the story forward.

            <Text>Troubleshooting Cloud Storage Providers
#
Many people today use cloud storage providers like Google Drive, OneDrive, DropBox, etc. Most of the time these work flawlessly however there can be times when cloud storage providers can cause problems with StoryCAD. 
If you are having issues with StoryCAD and store your outlines within a cloud storage provider or StoryCAD has opened this help article for you, then this page will walk you through troubleshooting these problems.

First its important to note that your outline isn’t lost/damaged or corrupted; it’s just not available locally to StoryCAD. 

With that out of the way, most problems with Cloud Storage Providers can be solved by simply connecting to the Internet or if you are already connected to the internet disconnecting and reconnecting should fix this. Once you have done this, try reopening the file within StoryCAD.

If the problem persists, then open File Explorer and navigate to the folder containing the Outline, if you don’t know where the file is located then StoryCAD will display the location of the outline if you hover over the name of the outline it in the StoryCAD File Open Menu (pictured below).
#

Once you have found the file in your system, right click the file and find the option to make it available offline/Always keep on device. (The wording and location of the option will vary depending on the cloud storage provider)

#

Once you’ve done this the file status field should have a green check-mark now and should say available offline in the File Explorer now. It may take a few moments to sync, but once it has the green check in the status field, it should be ready to open.#

If the problem still persists, then you should download the file from the cloud provider and store it somewhere that won’t be synced by the cloud storage provider.

If you’ve followed all the above and the issue still persists, contact support(support at StoryBuilder.org)</Text>

The Status Bar reports information you may find useful during program execution. It contains the following controls:

View Selector

Allows you to switch between Story Explorer and Story Narrator views.

Story Explorer is the view in which you create and edit your outline. The order and arrangement of story elements in the Navigation Pane is entirely under your control.

Story Narrator is a separate display of your outline’s Scene Story Elements arranged into the order you wish to tell your story in.

Status Message

The Status Message displays feedback information from the program to you.

Filter Status

Indicates if a Search is active.

Changed Indicator

 ##

The Changed Indicator displays red if any editing has been done to the outline and green if not. It’s a reminder to save your work. It’s also a command button which will save your outline if you click it.</Text>

            <Text>Defining Scenes

Scene workflow
The Scene form contains four tabs.

Scene tab

The scene tab contains the scene’s setting and its cast of characters, as well as a scene summary.

Development tab

This tab poses four questions that can guide the crafting of the scene.

Conflict tab

The Conflict tab applies the same GMC (goal, motivation and conflict) approach used in the Problem form at the scene level.

Sequel tab

The scene is the actions your character takes to achieve a goal (and the actions your character’s opponent takes to prevent it.) However, the scene itself  (especially if it’s an action scene) may not allow for your characters to react to the events. The Sequel tab is just that, an interlude between this scene and the one that follows to show the emotional response to the (often disastrous) scene, to reflect on it (alone or in dialog), and to come up with a new plan.

            <Text>Structure Tab

Structure is the order and manner in which you tell your story. Structure has two meanings. This tab is concerned with the constraints you put on the story (hopefully early in your story development.) The second meaning is concerned with the order and arrangement of story elements; you’ll create this as you develop your outline. 

#


Fields:

Type			     			The dramatic form in which you plan to tell your story. Each type roughly determines length, and has its own set of conventions and restrictions.

Genre						Each genre is a category characterized by its own style, form, and content, but more importantly, reader expectations.

Viewpoint				The person(s) and perspective from which the story is told. We recommend paying particular attention to viewpoint before  		

Viewpoint Character	For First Person and Limited Third Person viewpoints, the specific character.  		


Literary device			Literary devices are structural devices or gimmicks you can use to add meaning or tone. The proper literary device(s) can amplify your story’s message, but use caution.
	
Voice						The speech and thought patterns of the character(s) in the story. Beyond these forms of narration, a character’s voice is defined in his dialog.

Tense						Tense indicates when events or actions occurred in time—in the past, present, or future. Your verb choices can also indicate aspect (completeness or effect).

Style						Style is the way you use language, based on word choice, tone, syntax, and use of literary devices. Particular style are chosen depending on the desired effect.

Tone						Tone indicates the mood or impression you wish the reader to feel.</Text>

            <Text>Setting Tab


The Setting tab contains elements which make the setting specific and unique.

 
#

Locale	The location of the setting in space.

Season	These locate the setting in time.
Period

Lighting	These help to define the setting as a source of mood and atmosphere
Weather
Temperature	

Props	These elements make the scene specific for the characters, and therefore for the reader. An ashtray that a character nervously rocks back and forth is a prop. Props give characters little things to do (‘business’, in stage 

If a setting is used in multiple scenes, but the significance of the setting changes, with a different atmosphere or props, you may want to create a separate outline entry for the new setting.

            <Text>Problem Tab

This tabs contains elements which help to define a story problem.

#


Problem Type

There are three problem types:

Conflict	         The protagonist has a goal or objective, but something or someone (the antagonist) opposes the achievement of this goal.  The protagonist and the antagonist struggle until one or the other wins.

Decision	         This problem pattern ends with the protagonist making a difficult and important decision.  The problem is a choice.

Discovery	          The protagonist eventually makes a not too obvious discovery.  The discovery, which is the story's resolution, represents a change for him.	

Conflict Type

The nature of the antagonism between protagonist and antagonist.

Human vs. Nature       The protagonist eventually makes a not too obvious discovery.  The discovery, which is the story's resolution, represents a change for him.

Person vs. Person        The struggle may be two characters contending for the same prize, one person out to get another, or Odd Couple stories of characters with opposing traits, or ideological.

Person vs. Himself      The protagonist is his or her own antagonist.  The antagonistic side may be a destructive trait or habit, such as an addiction, or two opposing traits might fight for control in one soul.

Person vs. Society       ...In the form of prejudices, taboos, or traditions.

Person vs. Situation     This is typical of Underdog master plot stories; the situation is an overpowering juggernaut such as a war, poverty, the 'system', or a corrupt organization.

Person vs. Fate            Fate (old age, death, evil, etc.) is usually personified or illustrated as a character.

Person vs. Machine     The Machine's role may be as a symbol (for example, of dehumanizing society).  Pinocchio and Frankenstein are the archetypes of Person vs. Machine stories.

The terms 'human' and 'person' in these labels means that these roles are humanized, not that they must be humans.  The protagonist can be a dog, a wooden puppet, or a hobbit, but the reader must be able to identify with the character's humanity.  

Subject

This control identifies the basic area or type of problem.

The Subject control lists many of the common types of problems encountered in fiction.  

The problem subject should be as specific as possible.  If you start with a generic subject from the list, make it unique.  Instead of 'Being Hunted', you might say 'Chased by Lieutenant Girard.'

Story Question

The primary reason your reader reads your story is to find out how it comes out, to find the answer to a question the story poses.  It's useful to clarify exactly what that question is.
The story question can be framed as a yes or no question in terms of the protagonist's goal: 'Will Scarlett manage to save her plantation?', or 'How will Macbeth prove that his father was murdered?'

Consider whether the reader should know the story's outcome prior to the climax scene.  In many character-oriented stories the answer should be yes, and the story's dramatic arc deals with how things happen rather than what will happen.  If the answer should be no, the story question is the essential suspense of the story, and your plot must serve to keep the outcome in doubt.

Source of Conflict

This control identifies the beginning or origin of the problem.

Think of the story as a flow from a state of equilibrium (the way things were before the action started), through a state of change (the story itself) to a new state of equilibrium (resulting from the story's resolution.)  Source of Conflict identifies how the original equilibrium is shattered, and why a change is necessary.

The Source of Conflict is useful in identifying your story's point of attack, the opening scene.

The provided choices are generalized sources from which many problems spring. Be specific.  If you start with a generic source, replace it with one specific to your story and your protagonist.  Instead of  'Protagonist wants to change his situation'', say 'Joe wants to escape his poverty.'

            <Title>About StoryCAD</Title>
            <Text>StoryCAD is a software tool for fiction writers, whose purpose is to assist in creating the outline of a story. Think of a shopping list organized by aisle as an outline of a trip to the grocery store. The outline of your story is similar, but instead of bread and onions, the major parts in your story's list are 'story elements', such as characters, the conflicts that drive the story, your plot structure (scenes), and settings.
Story elements are the building blocks of stories. They're taught in classes and writer's workshops, distilled in a story summary or synopsis, and they're what readers describe when discuss a story. They're also what you'll ponder, agonize over, and dream and have nightmares about.
Each story element is a tangible object; you can describe it, break it down into smaller parts, and analyze it on its own. Is a character lifelike? Does he have agency? Does a setting contribue to the story's theme, or does it detract? Is your list of scenes linked by cause and effect? Does a scene have drama of its own? In StoryCAD, these story elements are created from templates- forms which organize and assist in thinking about that particular aspect of your story.
Elements are also fungible: they can be readily changed, moved around, or even thrown out and replaced with something better.
Once you understand story elements this way, you can think of them as parts in your story factory, designing them and fitting them together, or modifying them to better fit your design. You can even copy characters and settings from one story to another or into shared story worlds.
StoryCAD operates somewhat like a File Explorer, but instead of a hierarch of files and folders, StoryCAD's hierarchy is major story elements, which can be added, deleted, or rearranged. Each major story element- Problem, Character, Setting, and Scene- contain tabs which provide a progression or workflow to develop it. StoryCAD lets you focus on each story element separately, which simplifies the outlining process.
StoryCAD also provides thousands of examples for dozens of smaller story elements, in the form of pull-down lists of choices, although you're generally not required to stick to them. The examples aren't there to limit your imagination, but to encourage it; to eliminate writer's block. Together with StoryCAD's extensive documentation, they provide a short course in fiction writing. We believe that every story idea can be developed into a complete outline, ready for you to apply your unique voice and style from first draft to submission.
StoryCAD is Open-Source, meaning that it’s [source code](https://github.com/storybuilder-org/StoryCAD) is publicly and freely available and even if you can’t tell C-Sharp from B-Flat, you can still contribute to StoryCAD by reporting issues preferably on our GitHub repository or by emailing us.</Text>

            <Text>Psychological Tab

#

This tab contains information about the mental states and processes of the character.

Personality Type

There are a number of methods for classifying people according to personality type.   For example,  Aristotle classified personalities according to 'humor', or temperament, into four categories: melancholic, sanguine, emotional, and phlegmatic.  Carl Jung classified people as introverted or extroverted, and also used four categories: sensation, thinking, feeling, and intuitive. StoryCAD uses the Enneagram.  This system is very old, and is believed to have  originated with the Sufis in the Middle East.  It groups people into nine types ('ennea' is Greek for the number nine.)  The system teaches that people in a given type often behave and react in similar ways.

You may wish to use personality types to better understand what motivates your characters, and how they may think and feel in certain situations.  But remember that a personality type is just a stereotype.  No two people are alike: one may be an only child; the other, the youngest in a  large family.  One could be born to poverty, another to luxury.  Each character is shaped by different experiences.

Intelligence

Intelligence is the capacity to grasp meaning.  Action-based stories generally  require less intelligence in the protagonist than do character-based stories.  A character who reacts, rather than acts, can be less intelligent.

The antagonist should generally be as intelligent as the protagonist, to insure a fair struggle.

Values

People can have vastly different ideas of what is right or worthwhile in life. These 'governing values' are seldom articulated, but maintaining and defending them is a large influence on an individual's behavior, because her self image is tied to the values she holds.

In real life, people have multiple values.  In fiction, it's more useful to think in terms of just one or two values.  Conflict can be created by threatening your character's important value,  by giving her two opposing or exclusive values, or by destroying or removing a value.

Another way values can cause conflict (and therefore stories) is through misalignment of Values and Focus.  For example, if a man values his family, but spends too much time earning money to support them,  this can cause problems.

The choices for this trait represent common values people hold.  Be aware that different social backgrounds (especially different cultures and educational experiences)  may have profound effects on values.

Abnormality

This control describes the abnormal mental state of a character.

The line between normal and abnormal behavior is one of degrees.  Nor should you restrict unusual behavior to your villains.  A touch of abnormality adds color and unpredictability to a character.

Abnormal behaviors are complex and difficult to describe.  Be sure to research the specific illness you're using carefully.


Focus

The character's Focus is where he places his attention and activity.  His Focus (along with his Values) determine what's important to him.  From the perspective of plotting, these frequently determine what's at stake for the character, and therefore what should be put at risk— in other words, what the story problem should be about.

A character's Focus and his Values can be at odds, as a source of conflict in the story.
The character may discover that what he thinks is important isn't, or that values and focus he has neglected are truly important to him.  Stories of discovery and decision are often concerned with these traits.

Characters


Stories happen to people.  This is true even if your protagonist is a puppy or a switching engine.  If your character isn't a human being, you'll personify him.  The reader wants to feel vicariously what your characters are feeling.

Your story's success hinges on your ability to create strong, well-drawn characters.
 
This chapter describes StoryCAD's commands for defining and refining the characters in your story.

Trait Builder

This tool provides several categories of examples of outer (external) traits.

#

When you assign one of these traits to your character, think of how he came to have this characteristic.  Was there some incident in his background or element in his upbringing which fostered this trait? The Backstory Tab can be used to record this.

This section describes the content of the five Story Element types that comprise your outline’s details. Each tab contains related information and discussed separately.
In some cases, and particularly on the Story Overview Form, the order of the tabs suggests a workflow. In every case, the first tab is a good place to start.</Text>

You can add or remove Story Elements in two ways. There’s a Menu Bar button which opens an ‘Add/Remove Story Elements’ menu:

#

There’s also a pop-up menu which displays when you right-click on any Story Element node in the Navigation Pane:

#

(Hint: Holding your mouse or stylus over any of the buttons on a menu or pop-up menu will display a tip describing the button.)


The Remove Element button (trashcan icon) moves a Story Element to the Trashcan.

The Add to Narrative/Remove from Narrative buttons copy a Scene story element to the Narrative Explorer View or remove it from that view.  These do not remove the Scene from Story Explorer View.

            <Text>Plotting in Scenes

Outlining your story at the scene level (plotting) is where you move from the abstract level of characters and their problems to the specific events you’ll draft your story from.

Before diving into plotting in detail, we should define a few terms.

Let’s start with plot. The definition we like is borrowed from science fiction writer Jack Williamson, who defines plot as a patterned sequence of events, related by cause and effect, which portrays the whole response of a set of characters to a situation. 

Each separate event is a Scene story element. A scene takes place at one location and time, and has a specific cast of characters interacting with each other. Stage plays and movie scripts are necessarily written almost exclusively in scenes. Other story forms, such as novels and short stories, can contain foreshortened prose, but these days even those forms are mainly written in scenes, perhaps due to the influence of movies and television.

Certain events usually happen at fixed places in a story, a pattern called story structure. A plot has a beginning, middle, and end.  Aristotle described it as consisting of three movements, or acts. The first act, or setup, introduces us with characters with problems that must be solved. The second act, or rising action, presents obstacles as the characters try to solve their problems. The third act contains the logical outcome of the events in the first two acts. Most stories’ plots follow Aristotle's idea of story structure. 

The things that happen at a certain place in the plot (introduce the protagonist, present the problem to be solved, introduce an obstacle, solve the story problem (the climax), and so forth) are often called plot points, which the Oxford Dictionary defines as ‘a particularly significant part of a work of fiction.’ Another term for a plot point is a story beat.
